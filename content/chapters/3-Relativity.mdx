# Relativity as Geometry

## 1. Principle of Relativity

Einstein’s theory rests on two postulates:

1. **Relativity Principle**: The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.  
2. **Constancy of Light Speed**: The speed of light in vacuum, $c$, is invariant for all observers.

## 2. Special Relativity

### 2.1 Lorentz Transformations
Between two inertial frames moving at velocity $v$ along $x$:
$$
t' = \gamma \left(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}\right), \quad x' = \gamma (x - vt), \quad y' = y, \quad z' = z,
$$
with $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.

### 2.2 Time Dilation and Length Contraction
- Proper time:  
  $$
  d\tau^2 = dt^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2).
  $$
- Moving clocks tick slower: $\Delta t = \gamma \Delta \tau$.  
- Lengths contract along motion: $L = L_0 / \gamma$.

### 2.3 Energy–Momentum
Four-momentum:
$$
p^\mu = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec p\right), \quad E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.
$$

## 3. Minkowski Geometry

### 3.1 Spacetime Interval
Invariant under Lorentz transformations:
$$
ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2.
$$

### 3.2 Worldlines and Proper Time
The trajectory of a particle is a worldline; proper time is the invariant measure along it.

## 4. General Relativity

### 4.1 Principle of Equivalence
Locally, gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration. Thus, gravitation is encoded as spacetime curvature.

### 4.2 Einstein Field Equations
$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}.
$$
- $G_{\mu\nu}$: Einstein tensor (geometry)  
- $T_{\mu\nu}$: stress–energy tensor (matter/energy)  

### 4.3 Geodesics
Free-falling particles follow geodesics:
$$
\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0.
$$

## 5. Applications

- **Schwarzschild Solution**: black holes, gravitational time dilation.  
- **Cosmology**: expanding universe from Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) metric.  
- **Gravitational Waves**: ripples in spacetime traveling at $c$.

## 6. Summary
Relativity unifies space and time into a 4D geometry, replaces gravity with curvature, and provides the classical framework underlying modern cosmology and gravitational physics.
