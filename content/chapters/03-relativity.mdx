title: Relativity as Geometry
description: Minkowski first, then curvature. Geodesics, not forces.

Spacetime intervals (\(c=1\)):


$$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2. $$


In curved spacetime, replace with a **metric** \(g_{\mu\nu}\):


$$ ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}\,dx^\mu dx^\nu. $$


Freely falling particles follow **geodesics**: curves that extremize the proper time.
