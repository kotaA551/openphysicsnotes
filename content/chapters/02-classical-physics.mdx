title: From Newton to the Principle of Least Action
---


**Newton’s 2nd law**:


$$ F = m\,a. $$


**Principle of least action** (really: stationary action):


$$ S[q] = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot q, t)\,dt, \quad \delta S = 0. $$


This yields the **Euler–Lagrange** equations:


$$ \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0. $$


> Pattern: Choose coordinates $q$, write $L$, compute and go.
