title: Quantum Gravity Theory
---

Goal: quantize spacetime dynamics. Start from general relativity and ask how to treat the metric as a quantum field. We keep natural units ($\hbar=c=1$).

## 7.1  GR recap

Einstein–Hilbert action
$$
S_{\text{EH}}=\frac{1}{16\pi G}\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,R + S_{\text{m}}[g,\Phi],
$$
yields equations of motion
$$
G_{\mu\nu}\equiv R_{\mu\nu}-\tfrac12 g_{\mu\nu}R=8\pi G\,T_{\mu\nu}.
$$

## 7.2  Linearized gravity & the graviton

Expand around flat space $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+\kappa h_{\mu\nu}$ with $\kappa=\sqrt{32\pi G}$.
Diffeomorphisms act as a gauge symmetry:
$$
h_{\mu\nu}\to h_{\mu\nu}+ \partial_\mu\xi_\nu+\partial_\nu\xi_\mu .
$$
Gauge-fix (e.g. de Donder) to get a massless spin-2 propagator. Coupling is universal: $h_{\mu\nu}$ couples to the conserved stress tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$.

## 7.3  Why perturbative QG is hard

Power counting shows non-renormalizability in $4$D: $\kappa$ has negative mass dimension ($[\kappa]=-1$), so higher-loop divergences require an infinite tower of counterterms (e.g. $R^2$, $R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$, …).

## 7.4  Effective field theory (EFT) viewpoint

Treat GR as the leading term of a **low-energy EFT** valid below the Planck scale $M_{\text{Pl}}=1/\sqrt{G}$.  
The action organizes operators by dimension:
$$
S=\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\left[\frac{1}{16\pi G}R
+\alpha_1 R^2+\alpha_2 R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}
+\alpha_3 R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}+\cdots\right].
$$
Predictions at $E\ll M_{\text{Pl}}$ are finite and calculable after renormalizing the $\alpha_i$’s.

## 7.5  Black holes & quantum effects

Semiclassical gravity: quantize matter on a classical background.  
Hawking radiation gives temperature and entropy
$$
T_H=\frac{\kappa_{\text{surf}}}{2\pi},\qquad
S_{\text{BH}}=\frac{A}{4G} ,
$$
where $A$ is horizon area. This leads to the information problem and motivates UV-complete theories.

## 7.6  Candidate UV completions (bird’s-eye)

- **String theory:** gravity emerges from a massless spin-2 mode of a closed string; UV softened by extended objects; extra dimensions, dualities, AdS/CFT.
- **Asymptotic safety:** conjectured non-trivial UV fixed point of the gravitational RG flow.
- **Loop quantum gravity:** background-independent quantization of geometry (spin networks/spin foams).
- **Higher-derivative gravity:** adding $R^2$ terms can make perturbation theory renormalizable but may introduce ghosts unless arranged carefully.

## 7.7  Path integral & gauge fixing (sketch)

Expand around a background $\bar g_{\mu\nu}$:
$$
Z=\int \mathcal D h_{\mu\nu}\, \exp\!\left[i S_{\text{EH}}[\bar g+h]\right],
$$
impose a gauge condition $\mathcal F_\mu(h)=0$ and include Faddeev–Popov ghosts.  
Background-field method preserves background gauge invariance and streamlines EFT computations.

## 7.8  Linearized observables

For weak fields, gravitational waves satisfy
$$
\square \,\bar h_{\mu\nu}=0,\qquad \partial^\mu \bar h_{\mu\nu}=0,
$$
with transverse–traceless polarizations $h_{+},h_{\times}$. Energy loss from binaries matches GR and provides quantum-field-style external states (gravitons) at long distances.

## 7.9  Scales to remember

Planck length and energy
$$
\ell_{\text{Pl}}=\sqrt{G}\approx 1.6\times10^{-35}\ \text{m},\qquad
M_{\text{Pl}}\approx 1.22\times10^{19}\ \text{GeV}.
$$
Quantum gravity effects are tiny at everyday energies; EFT ≈ GR + small quantum corrections.

**Takeaway:** Treat GR as an EFT at low energies; black-hole thermodynamics proves quantum effects are real; UV completion may be strings, asymptotic safety, loop gravity, or something new. Meanwhile, linearized gravity and EFT already let us compute sensible, testable quantum-gravitational corrections.
