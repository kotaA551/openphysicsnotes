# Chapter 9: Statistical physics

## 9.1 Foundations: From Microstates to Thermodynamics

Statistical physics is the art of predicting **macroscopic** laws from **microscopic** uncertainty. We never know the exact $10^{23}$-body state; instead we organize ignorance into **ensembles** whose averages reproduce temperature, pressure, magnetization, and friends. This section builds the core: microstates vs macrostates, the fundamental postulate, the three standard ensembles, and the thermodynamic limit. We also show how the **information-theoretic** view turns “maximum entropy” into the unique engine behind the familiar distributions.

---

### 9.1.1 Microstates, macrostates, and phase space

A **microstate** is a complete specification of the system’s degrees of freedom. For $N$ classical point particles, it is a point in $6N$-dimensional **phase space** with coordinates

$$
\Gamma \equiv (\mathbf r_{1},\dots,\mathbf r_{N};\mathbf p_{1},\dots,\mathbf p_{N})
$$

A **macrostate** is defined by a few bulk variables, e.g., $(E,V,N)$ for an isolated gas. Many microstates map to the same macrostate. Counting how many leads to entropy.

Liouville’s theorem states that Hamiltonian flow is **incompressible** in phase space, so volume elements are preserved along trajectories. This makes uniform distributions over energy shells dynamically consistent.

---

### 9.1.2 Fundamental postulate and Boltzmann’s principle

**Fundamental postulate.** For an isolated system with fixed $(E,V,N)$ at equilibrium, all microstates compatible with these constraints are **equally likely**.

Let $\Omega(E,V,N)$ be the number of microstates with energies in $[E,E+\delta E]$ for a small but macroscopic $\delta E$. Then the **entropy** is

$$
S(E,V,N) = k_{B}\,\ln \Omega(E,V,N)
$$

Thermodynamic temperature follows from

$$
\frac{1}{T} = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial E}\right)_{V,N}
$$

and pressure and chemical potential are

$$
\frac{p}{T} = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{E,N},\qquad -\,\frac{\mu}{T} = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial N}\right)_{E,V}
$$

For weakly interacting subsystems $A$ and $B$, additivity of $S$ at fixed total $E$ yields the equilibrium condition $T_{A}=T_{B}$ by maximizing $S_{A}(E_{A})+S_{B}(E_{B})$ subject to $E_{A}+E_{B}=E$.

---

### 9.1.3 Thermodynamic limit, extensivity, and concavity

Define the **thermodynamic limit** as $N\to\infty$, $V\to\infty$ with $n=N/V$ fixed. In this limit:

- Entropy becomes **extensive**: $S(\lambda E,\lambda V,\lambda N)\approx \lambda S(E,V,N)$  
- $S$ is **concave** in its natural variables, ensuring stability and positive heat capacities where appropriate  
- Fluctuations of **intensive** variables shrink like $1/\sqrt{N}$, making thermodynamics sharp

Short-range interactions guarantee ensemble equivalence; long-range cases (self-gravity, unscreened Coulomb) can violate additivity and need care.

---

### 9.1.4 Microcanonical ensemble

The microcanonical density is uniform on the constant-energy hypersurface:

$$
\rho_{\text{mc}}(\Gamma) = \frac{1}{\Omega(E,V,N)}\,\delta\!\left(H(\Gamma)-E\right)
$$

Expectations are

$$
\langle A\rangle_{\text{mc}} = \frac{1}{\Omega}\int d\Gamma\;A(\Gamma)\,\delta\!\left(H(\Gamma)-E\right)
$$

Maximizing $S=k_{B}\ln\Omega$ subject to constraints reproduces thermodynamic relations. For many systems this is the conceptual anchor; in practice the canonical ensemble is often easier to compute with and becomes equivalent at large $N$.

---

### 9.1.5 Canonical ensemble via a heat bath

Place system $S$ weakly coupled to a huge reservoir $R$ with fixed $E_{\text{tot}}$. The probability that $S$ is found in microstate $i$ with energy $E_{i}$ is proportional to the number of reservoir states at energy $E_{\text{tot}}-E_{i}$:

$$
P(i) \propto \Omega_{R}(E_{\text{tot}}-E_{i}) \approx \exp\!\left[\frac{1}{k_{B}}\,S_{R}(E_{\text{tot}})-\frac{E_{i}}{k_{B}T}\right] \propto e^{-\beta E_{i}}
$$

with inverse temperature $\beta \equiv 1/(k_{B}T)$. Normalize to get

$$
P(i) = \frac{e^{-\beta E_{i}}}{Z},\qquad Z(\beta,V,N) \equiv \sum_{i} e^{-\beta E_{i}}
$$

$Z$ is the **partition function**. Thermodynamic potentials follow:

$$
F(T,V,N) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln Z
$$

$$
U = \langle E\rangle = -\,\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\ln Z
$$

$$
S = -\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\right)_{V,N} = k_{B}\left(\ln Z + \beta U\right)
$$

Energy fluctuations satisfy

$$
\langle (\Delta E)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}
$$

so relative fluctuations scale as $1/\sqrt{N}$ for normal systems.

---

### 9.1.6 Grand canonical ensemble: exchanging particles

If both energy and particles exchange with a reservoir, the probability of microstate $i$ with $(E_{i},N_{i})$ is

$$
P(i) = \frac{e^{-\beta(E_{i}-\mu N_{i})}}{\Xi}
$$

with **grand partition function**

$$
\Xi(\beta,V,\mu) \equiv \sum_{N=0}^{\infty}\sum_{i\in N} e^{-\beta(E_{i}-\mu N)}
$$

Define the grand potential

$$
\Phi_{G}(T,V,\mu) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln \Xi
$$

Then

$$
p = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\mu},\quad N = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V},\quad S = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial T}\right)_{V,\mu}
$$

Fluctuations:

$$
\langle (\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V}
$$

and energy–number covariances come from mixed derivatives of $\ln \Xi$.

---

### 9.1.7 Legendre transforms and thermodynamic potentials

Thermodynamics is organized by Legendre transforms that swap natural variables:

- $S=S(E,V,N)$  
- $F=U-TS$ with natural variables $(T,V,N)$  
- $G=F+pV$ with $(T,p,N)$  
- $H=U+pV$ with $(S,p,N)$  
- $\Phi_{G}=F-\mu N$ with $(T,V,\mu)$

Maxwell relations follow from equality of mixed partial derivatives, e.g.,

$$
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} = \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}
$$

---

### 9.1.8 Information-theoretic foundation (Jaynes view)

Let $\{p_{i}\}$ be probabilities over microstates. **Maximize** the Shannon entropy

$$
\mathcal S[p] \equiv -k_{B}\sum_{i} p_{i}\ln p_{i}
$$

subject to known constraints. With only normalization and mean energy fixed, Lagrange multipliers give

$$
p_{i} = \frac{e^{-\beta E_{i}}}{Z}
$$

With energy and particle number constraints, one obtains the grand canonical form $p_{i}\propto e^{-\beta(E_{i}-\mu N_{i})}$. Thus ensembles are the **least biased** distributions compatible with macroscopic data.

Relative entropy $D(p\Vert q)=\sum p_{i}\ln(p_{i}/q_{i})\ge 0$ measures distance to a prior $q$. Many fluctuation theorems and linear-response results are compact in this language.

---

### 9.1.9 Large deviations, concentration, and ensemble equivalence

For $N\gg 1$, probabilities concentrate exponentially near thermodynamic values. If $A$ is an additive observable,

$$
\mathbb P\!\left(\frac{A}{N}\approx a\right)\sim e^{-N\,I(a)}
$$

with a **rate function** $I(a)\ge 0$ that vanishes at the equilibrium value. Under standard convexity conditions:

- Microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles are **equivalent** in the thermodynamic limit  
- Nonconcavities signal phase coexistence; Maxwell constructions repair them at the level of thermodynamic potentials

---

### 9.1.10 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Two-level system**  
Energy levels $0$ and $\epsilon$ for $N$ noninteracting sites. Canonical partition function per site

$$
z = 1 + e^{-\beta\epsilon}
$$

Total $Z=z^{N}$. Average energy $U=N\,\epsilon/(e^{\beta\epsilon}+1)$ and heat capacity shows a Schottky peak near $k_{B}T\sim \epsilon$.

**(b) Classical harmonic oscillator**  
Single oscillator with $E_{n}=(n+\tfrac12)\hbar\omega$ gives

$$
Z = \frac{e^{-\beta\hbar\omega/2}}{1-e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}}
$$

Average energy $U=\frac{\hbar\omega}{2}+\frac{\hbar\omega}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1}$ tends to $k_{B}T$ at high $T$ (equipartition) and to $\hbar\omega/2$ at $T\to 0$.

**(c) Coin toss and Stirling**  
For $N$ independent fair coins, the multiplicity of $k$ heads is $\binom{N}{k}\approx \exp\!\left[N\,H(k/N)\right]/\sqrt{2\pi N x(1-x)}$ with $x=k/N$ and binary entropy $H(x)=-x\ln x-(1-x)\ln(1-x)$. This is the large-deviation archetype.

**(d) Ideal gas microcanonical temperature**  
For a classical ideal gas, counting states yields

$$
\Omega(E,V,N) \propto \frac{V^{N}E^{\tfrac{3N}{2}-1}}{N!\,\Gamma\!\left(\tfrac{3N}{2}\right)}
$$

so $S=k_{B}\ln\Omega$ gives $U=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T$ and $pV=Nk_{B}T$ after Stirling.

**(e) Canonical fluctuations**  
Show $\langle (\Delta E)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}$ by taking $\partial^{2}_{\beta}\ln Z$ and relate the heat capacity to curvature of $\ln Z$.

---

### 9.1.11 Minimal problem kit

- Starting from $S=k_{B}\ln\Omega$, derive $1/T=(\partial S/\partial E)_{V,N}$ and $p/T=(\partial S/\partial V)_{E,N}$  
- Derive the canonical ensemble by maximizing $\mathcal S[p]$ with constraints $\sum p_{i}=1$ and $\sum p_{i}E_{i}=U$  
- Show that $F=-k_{B}T\ln Z$ implies $S=-\partial F/\partial T$ and $p=-\partial F/\partial V$  
- For a classical ideal gas, compute $\Omega(E,V,N)$ up to a constant using phase-space volume and obtain the Sackur–Tetrode entropy  
- Prove $\langle (\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\,(\partial N/\partial\mu)_{T,V}$ in the grand canonical ensemble  
- Discuss when ensemble equivalence fails and give a physical example with long-range forces

---

**In summary:** Microstates live in phase space; macrostates live in a few variables. Equiprobability on the energy shell plus counting delivers $S=k_{B}\ln\Omega$. Coupling to reservoirs yields the canonical and grand canonical ensembles, with partition functions generating all thermodynamics. In the thermodynamic limit, fluctuations shrink, ensembles agree, and entropy’s concavity secures stability. Information-theoretic maximum entropy ties it together as the unique, least-biased inference consistent with macroscopic data.


## 9.2 Partition Functions & Thermodynamic Potentials

Partition functions are the generators of everything thermodynamic. Once you have $Z$ or $\Xi$ or the $N\!pT$ analogue, derivatives give you $U,p,S,\mu$ and all the response coefficients. This section builds the canonical and grand-canonical machinery, adds the isothermal–isobaric ensemble, and shows how Legendre transforms and saddle points tie them back to microcanonical entropy. Worked examples anchor the formulas.

---

### 9.2.1 Canonical partition function and cumulants

For fixed $(T,V,N)$ the canonical weights are $P(i)\propto e^{-\beta E_{i}}$ with

$$
Z(\beta,V,N) \equiv \sum_{i} e^{-\beta E_{i}}
$$

Helmholtz free energy

$$
F(T,V,N) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln Z
$$

Standard derivatives

$$
U \equiv \langle E\rangle = -\,\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\ln Z
$$

$$
S = -\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\right)_{V,N} = k_{B}\left(\ln Z + \beta U\right)
$$

$$
p = -\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial V}\right)_{T,N}
$$

Energy cumulants follow from derivatives of $\ln Z$ with respect to $\beta$. For instance

$$
\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle = \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \beta^{2}}\ln Z = k_{B}T^{2} C_{V}
$$

Generalized forces for a control parameter $\lambda$ that enters $H(\lambda)$ obey

$$
\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda}\right)_{T,V,N} = \left\langle \frac{\partial H}{\partial \lambda}\right\rangle
$$

Examples: $M = -\left(\partial F/\partial B\right)_{T,V,N}$ for a magnetic field $B$ and $p = -\left(\partial F/\partial V\right)_{T,N}$ for volume.

---

### 9.2.2 Grand partition function, fugacity, and pressure

When particle number fluctuates at fixed $(T,V,\mu)$

$$
\Xi(\beta,V,\mu) \equiv \sum_{N=0}^{\infty}\sum_{i\in N} e^{-\beta(E_{i}-\mu N)}
$$

Define the grand potential

$$
\Phi_{G}(T,V,\mu) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln \Xi
$$

Thermodynamics in this ensemble is compact

$$
p = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\mu}
$$

$$
N = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V}
$$

$$
S = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial T}\right)_{V,\mu}
$$

It is common to use the **fugacity** $z\equiv e^{\beta \mu}$. Number fluctuations and compressibility are linked by

$$
\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V}
$$

For a uniform ideal gas one finds the handy identity $pV = k_{B}T \ln \Xi$.

---

### 9.2.3 Isothermal–isobaric ensemble and Gibbs free energy

Many experiments hold $(T,p,N)$ fixed. The isothermal–isobaric partition function is the Laplace transform of $Z$ over $V$

$$
\Delta(\beta,p,N) \equiv \int_{0}^{\infty} dV\; e^{-\beta p V}\, Z(\beta,V,N)
$$

Its thermodynamic potential is the **Gibbs free energy**

$$
G(T,p,N) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln \Delta
$$

Then

$$
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial p}\right)_{T,N} = V,\qquad
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p,N} = -S,\qquad
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial N}\right)_{T,p} = \mu
$$

Fluctuations of $V$ at fixed $(T,p,N)$ are generated by derivatives of $\ln \Delta$.

---

### 9.2.4 Legendre structure and microcanonical link

Canonical and grand-canonical ensembles are **Laplace transforms** of the microcanonical state count

$$
Z(\beta,V,N) = \int dE\; \Omega(E,V,N)\,e^{-\beta E}
$$

For large systems the integral is dominated by a saddle point $E^{\ast}$ with $\partial_{E}\ln\Omega|_{E^{\ast}}=\beta$, i.e., $1/T = \partial S/\partial E$. Evaluating at the saddle yields the Legendre relation

$$
F(T,V,N) = U - T S
$$

Similarly, the grand-canonical transform over both $E$ and $N$ yields

$$
\Phi_{G}(T,V,\mu) = U - T S - \mu N
$$

These are the reasons thermodynamic potentials are Legendre transforms of $S$.

---

### 9.2.5 Ideal classical gas in the canonical ensemble

Take $N$ indistinguishable particles of mass $m$ with Hamiltonian $H=\sum p_{i}^{2}/2m$ and ignore interactions. The canonical partition function factorizes into a translational part

$$
Z(\beta,V,N) = \frac{1}{N!}\left[\frac{V}{\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right]^{N}
$$

with thermal wavelength

$$
\lambda_{T} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{2\pi \hbar^{2}}{m k_{B} T}}
$$

Then

$$
F = -\,k_{B}T \ln Z = -\,Nk_{B}T\left[\ln\!\left(\frac{V}{N\,\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right) + 1\right]
$$

Equation of state follows immediately

$$
pV = Nk_{B}T
$$

Entropy is the Sackur–Tetrode form

$$
S = Nk_{B}\left[\ln\!\left(\frac{V}{N\,\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right) + \frac{5}{2}\right]
$$

and the internal energy is $U=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T$ with $C_{V}=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}$. The $1/N!$ cures the Gibbs paradox by enforcing indistinguishability.

---

### 9.2.6 Quantum ideal gases via the cluster expansion

For noninteracting bosons or fermions with one-particle energies $\{\epsilon_{\alpha}\}$

$$
\ln \Xi = \pm \sum_{\alpha} \ln\!\left(1 \mp z\,e^{-\beta \epsilon_{\alpha}}\right)
$$

upper sign for bosons, lower for fermions. Occupations are

$$
\langle n_{\alpha}\rangle = \frac{1}{z^{-1}e^{\beta \epsilon_{\alpha}} \mp 1}
$$

In the continuum limit one replaces $\sum_{\alpha}\to \int d\epsilon\,g(\epsilon)$ to obtain thermodynamics of photon, phonon, or electron gases. Interactions can be included perturbatively via virial or cluster expansions that correct $\ln \Xi$ by coefficients $B_{2},B_{3},\dots$.

---

### 9.2.7 Generalized forces and response matrices

If a Hamiltonian depends on external controls $\boldsymbol{\lambda}=(\lambda_{1},\dots)$, the matrix of second derivatives of $F$ gives linear response

$$
\chi_{ab} \equiv -\left(\frac{\partial^{2} F}{\partial \lambda_{a}\,\partial \lambda_{b}}\right)_{T,V,N} = \beta\,\langle \Delta X_{a}\,\Delta X_{b}\rangle
$$

where $X_{a}\equiv -\partial H/\partial \lambda_{a}$ is the conjugate observable. Examples include magnetic susceptibility, compressibility, and heat capacities. Mixed derivatives encode Maxwell relations, e.g., $\left(\partial S/\partial V\right)_{T,N}=\left(\partial p/\partial T\right)_{V,N}$.

---

### 9.2.8 Ising-like lattice systems and counting practice

For a finite lattice with spins $s_{i}=\pm 1$ and Hamiltonian $H=-J\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}s_{i}s_{j}-h\sum_{i}s_{i}$ the canonical partition function is

$$
Z(\beta,h) = \sum_{\lbrace s\rbrace} \exp\!\left[\beta J \sum_{\langle ij\rangle}s_{i}s_{j} + \beta h \sum_{i}s_{i}\right]
$$

While exact evaluation is hard beyond 1D, derivatives of $\ln Z$ still define magnetization $M=\left(\partial \ln Z/\partial (\beta h)\right)$ and susceptibility $\chi=\partial M/\partial h$. Mean-field or transfer-matrix approaches approximate $Z$ systematically.

---

### 9.2.9 Gibbs–Duhem and extensivity checks

For an extensive system with $U(S,V,N)$ homogeneous of degree one, Euler’s relation holds

$$
U = TS - pV + \mu N
$$

Differentiating yields the **Gibbs–Duhem** equation

$$
S\,dT - V\,dp + N\,d\mu = 0
$$

This is a consistency check for any equation of state you derive from a partition function.

---

### 9.2.10 Laplace tricks, saddle points, and when ensembles match

Because $Z$ and $\Delta$ are Laplace transforms, large-$N$ thermodynamics follows from their leading saddle. Concavity of $S(E,V,N)$ guarantees equivalence of ensembles. At first-order transitions $Z$ develops multiple competing saddles; Legendre transforms pick the convex envelope, and fluctuations become non-Gaussian in finite systems.

---

### 9.2.11 Worked mini-examples

**(a) $N\!pT$ ideal gas**

Compute $\Delta$ for the ideal gas using $Z=(V/\lambda_{T}^{3})^{N}/N!$ to show

$$
\Delta = \frac{1}{N!}\left(\frac{k_{B}T}{p\,\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right)^{N}
$$

and verify $G=Nk_{B}T\ln\!\left(p\,\lambda_{T}^{3}/k_{B}T\right) + Nk_{B}T$ and $V = \left(\partial G/\partial p\right)_{T,N} = Nk_{B}T/p$.

**(b) Pressure from $Z$ via the virial**

For a classical interacting gas with pair potential $u(r)$, show that $p = Nk_{B}T/V - \tfrac{2\pi n^{2}}{3}\int_{0}^{\infty} dr\, r^{3} u'(r) g(r)$ using $p=-(\partial F/\partial V)_{T,N}$ and a uniform scaling argument, where $n=N/V$ and $g(r)$ is the pair distribution.

**(c) Number fluctuations and compressibility**

In the grand ensemble, verify $\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\,\left(\partial N/\partial \mu\right)_{T,V}$ and relate to the isothermal compressibility $\kappa_{T}=\frac{1}{n^{2}}\left(\partial n/\partial \mu\right)_{T}$.

**(d) Microcanonical ↔ canonical**

Starting from $Z=\int dE\,\exp[S(E)/k_{B}-\beta E]$, perform a quadratic expansion of $S(E)$ about $E^{\ast}$ to obtain Gaussian energy fluctuations with variance $k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}$.

**(e) Two-level system free energy**

For $N$ independent two-level sites with energies $0$ and $\epsilon$, compute $Z=(1+e^{-\beta\epsilon})^{N}$, then $F$, $S$, and $C_{V}$ and locate the Schottky peak.

---

### 9.2.12 Minimal problem kit

- Derive all canonical relations for $U,S,p$ starting from $F=-k_{B}T\ln Z$ and verify the Maxwell relation $\left(\partial S/\partial V\right)_{T,N}=\left(\partial p/\partial T\right)_{V,N}$  
- Show that in the grand ensemble, $pV=k_{B}T\ln\Xi$ for an ideal gas and obtain $N$ and $S$ from derivatives of $\ln\Xi$  
- Compute the isothermal–isobaric partition function for a classical harmonic solid treated as $3N$ independent oscillators and extract $G(T,p,N)$ in the limit of weak compressibility  
- Using $\ln \Xi = \pm\sum_{\alpha}\ln(1\mp z e^{-\beta\epsilon_{\alpha}})$, recover the Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac distributions and the classical limit when $z\ll 1$  
- From extensivity, prove Euler’s relation $U=TS-pV+\mu N$ and then the Gibbs–Duhem equation, and test them on the ideal gas results above

---

**In summary:** Partition functions are the engines of thermodynamics. $Z$ gives you $F$ and all canonical data, $\Xi$ gives $\Phi_{G}$ and number fluctuations, and $\Delta$ hands you $G$ at fixed pressure. They are Laplace-transformed faces of the same microcanonical counting, glued together by Legendre transforms. Once you can push derivatives of $\ln$ partition functions with confidence, every equilibrium calculation becomes a few lines of algebra

## 9.3 Classical Ideal Gas & Equipartition

The classical ideal gas is the training montage of statistical physics: you learn to count states, take derivatives of $\ln$ partition functions, and watch macroscopic laws fall out like it’s nothing. We derive the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, prove equipartition, recover $pV=Nk_{B}T$, and build intuition for adiabats, sound speed, and when the classical picture breaks (hello, $\lambda_{T}$).

---

### 9.3.1 Canonical counting recap and the ideal-gas Z

For $N$ indistinguishable point particles of mass $m$ in volume $V$ with Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf p_{i}^{2}/2m$, the canonical partition function factorizes:

$$
Z(\beta,V,N) = \frac{1}{N!}\left[\frac{V}{\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right]^{N}
$$

with thermal wavelength

$$
\lambda_{T} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar^{2}}{m k_{B} T}}
$$

Thermodynamics then follows immediately:

$$
F = -\,Nk_{B}T\left[\ln\!\left(\frac{V}{N\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right) + 1\right],\qquad
U = \frac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T,\qquad
pV = Nk_{B}T
$$

Heat capacities:

$$
C_{V} = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{V,N} = \frac{3}{2}Nk_{B},\qquad
C_{p} = C_{V} + Nk_{B} = \frac{5}{2}Nk_{B},\qquad
\gamma \equiv \frac{C_{p}}{C_{V}} = \frac{5}{3}
$$

Entropy is the Sackur–Tetrode form:

$$
S = Nk_{B}\left[\ln\!\left(\frac{V}{N\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right) + \frac{5}{2}\right]
$$

The $1/N!$ kills the Gibbs paradox by encoding indistinguishability.

---

### 9.3.2 Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (velocities, speeds, energies)

Each momentum component is Gaussian:

$$
f(p_{x}) = \sqrt{\frac{\beta}{2\pi m}}\;\exp\!\left(-\frac{\beta p_{x}^{2}}{2m}\right)
$$

Equivalently, each velocity component is Gaussian with variance $\langle v_{x}^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T/m$. The **speed** distribution (radial in velocity space) is

$$
f(v) = 4\pi \left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_{B}T}\right)^{3/2} v^{2} \exp\!\left(-\frac{m v^{2}}{2k_{B}T}\right)
$$

Useful moments:

$$
v_{\text{mp}} = \sqrt{\frac{2k_{B}T}{m}},\qquad
\langle v\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{8k_{B}T}{\pi m}},\qquad
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}
$$

The kinetic energy distribution is $\chi^{2}$-like with $3$ degrees of freedom:

$$
f(E) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{1}{(k_{B}T)^{3/2}}\sqrt{E}\,e^{-E/k_{B}T},\qquad \langle E\rangle = \frac{3}{2}k_{B}T
$$

---

### 9.3.3 Equipartition theorem

**Statement.** Every quadratic degree of freedom in the Hamiltonian contributes $\tfrac{1}{2}k_{B}T$ to the mean energy.

**Sketch of proof (canonical, integration by parts).** If $H$ contains a term $\alpha x^{2}$, then

$$
\langle x\,\partial H/\partial x \rangle = k_{B}T
$$

For $H=\sum p_{i}^{2}/2m + \cdots$, each quadratic $p_{i}^{2}/2m$ gives $\langle p_{i}^{2}/2m\rangle = \tfrac{1}{2}k_{B}T$. A monatomic gas has $3N$ translational momenta → $U=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T$.

**When it fails (and why that’s good).** If a degree of freedom isn’t effectively quadratic (e.g., quantized rotations/vibrations at $k_{B}T$ below level spacings), equipartition “freezes out.” This explains the drop of specific heats at low $T$ and the success/failure of Dulong–Petit.

---

### 9.3.4 Kinetic-theory

From elastic impacts on a wall, the pressure can be written

$$
p = \frac{2}{3}\frac{U}{V}
$$

Combine with $U=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T$ to get $pV=Nk_{B}T$. More generally, for pairwise interactions $u(r)$ the **virial theorem** yields

$$
pV = Nk_{B}T + \frac{1}{3}\left\langle \sum_{i<j} \mathbf r_{ij}\cdot \mathbf F_{ij} \right\rangle
$$

The ideal gas has $\mathbf F_{ij}=0$, so the second term vanishes.

---

### 9.3.5 Adiabats, sound speed, and quick thermodynamic moves

For a **reversible adiabatic** change ($dQ=0$) in a monatomic ideal gas,

$$
p V^{\gamma} = \text{const},\qquad T V^{\gamma-1} = \text{const},\qquad T^{\gamma} p^{1-\gamma} = \text{const}
$$

with $\gamma=5/3$. The **speed of sound** (small adiabatic density waves) is

$$
c_{s} = \sqrt{\gamma \frac{k_{B}T}{m}}
$$

For mixtures, replace $m$ by the mean molecular mass and $\gamma$ by the appropriate ratio of heat capacities.

---

### 9.3.6 External fields: barometric formula and separability

In a uniform gravitational field $U(z)=mgz$, the one-body Boltzmann weight factorizes:

$$
n(z) \propto e^{-\beta m g z},\qquad n(z) = n(0)\,e^{-z/H},\qquad H \equiv \frac{k_{B}T}{m g}
$$

The momentum and position parts separate, so kinetic-energy results (equipartition, MB speeds) survive untouched.

---

### 9.3.7 Transport in one screen: mean free path and friends

For hard spheres of diameter $d$ at number density $n$, the mean free path is

$$
\ell \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\,\pi d^{2}\,n}
$$

Using typical speed $\bar v \sim \langle v\rangle$,

$$
D \sim \frac{1}{3}\bar v\,\ell,\qquad
\eta \sim \frac{1}{3} n m \bar v\,\ell,\qquad
\kappa \sim \frac{1}{3} n C_{V}^{\text{per particle}} \bar v\,\ell
$$

These kinetic-theory scalings are remarkably good for dilute gases; real cross sections and mixtures refine the prefactors.

---

### 9.3.8 Validity of the classical picture

Classical, nondegenerate behavior requires the **diluteness** parameter to be small:

$$
n\,\lambda_{T}^{3} \ll 1
$$

If $n\lambda_{T}^{3}\gtrsim 1$ (low $T$ or high $n$), quantum statistics kicks in: bosons want Bose–Einstein, fermions go Pauli, and the MB distribution is no longer the move.

---

### 9.3.9 Beyond monatomic: what equipartition counts

For a rigid **linear diatomic** at intermediate $T$:

- $3$ translational + $2$ rotational quadratic modes → $f=5$ effective d.o.f., so $C_{V} \approx \tfrac{5}{2}Nk_{B}$, $\gamma \approx 7/5$
- Vibrations add $2$ more quadratic modes but only when $k_{B}T$ exceeds the vibrational quantum spacing; otherwise they’re frozen

Moral: **count only the modes that are active at your $T$**.

---

### 9.3.10 Worked mini-examples

**(a) RMS speed for air at room $T$**

For $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ with $m\approx 28\,\mathrm{u}$ at $T=300\ \mathrm{K}$,

$$
v_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}
$$

Plug numbers to get a few hundred $\mathrm{m/s}$; compare to $v_{\text{mp}}$ and $\langle v\rangle$.

**(b) Adiabatic compression**

A monatomic gas is compressed from $(p_{1},V_{1})$ to $(p_{2},V_{2})$ adiabatically. Use $pV^{\gamma}=\text{const}$ to find $T_{2}/T_{1}=(V_{1}/V_{2})^{\gamma-1}$.

**(c) Barometric scale height of helium**

For He at $T=300\ \mathrm{K}$, compute $H=k_{B}T/(m g)$ and compare to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ to see the mass dependence pop.

**(d) Mean free path at STP**

Take $d\approx 0.3\ \mathrm{nm}$, $n\approx 2.5\times 10^{25}\ \mathrm{m}^{-3}$; estimate $\ell$ and comment on why smells diffuse fast.

**(e) Equipartition sanity check**

Show directly from $\int dp\;p^{2} e^{-\beta p^{2}/2m}$ that $\langle p^{2}/2m\rangle = \tfrac{1}{2}k_{B}T$ and extend to three components.

---

### 9.3.11 Minimal problem kit

- Starting from $f(v)$, derive $v_{\text{mp}}$, $\langle v\rangle$, and $v_{\text{rms}}$  
- Prove the equipartition identity $\langle x\,\partial H/\partial x\rangle=k_{B}T$ for a quadratic coordinate and apply it to $p^{2}/2m$  
- Derive $p=\tfrac{2}{3}U/V$ via wall-collision counting and recover $pV=Nk_{B}T$  
- For a linear diatomic with rotational constant $B$, estimate the temperature where rotations “turn on” by comparing $k_{B}T$ to $\hbar^{2}/(2I)$  
- Check the classicality criterion for a cold atomic gas of density $n$ and temperature $T$: compute $n\lambda_{T}^{3}$ and discuss when quantum statistics is required

---

**In summary:** The ideal gas is a showcase: Gaussian components give Maxwell speeds; each quadratic mode chips in $\tfrac{1}{2}k_{B}T$; from that, $U$, $C_{V}$, $pV=Nk_{B}T$, adiabats, and sound speed fall out in two lines. When $n\lambda_{T}^{3}$ grows or level spacings matter, equipartition politely bows out and quantum statistics takes the mic


## 9.4 Fluctuations & the Fluctuation–Response Principle

Macroscopic laws look crisp because relative fluctuations scale like $1/\sqrt{N}$—until they don’t. This section organizes **what fluctuates**, **how much**, and **why responses equal fluctuations**. We connect the canonical, grand-canonical, and isothermal–isobaric ensembles; introduce static fluctuation–dissipation relations; link pair correlations to compressibility; and preview what breaks near critical points.

---

### 9.4.1 Energy and number: the two flagship variances

**Canonical (fixed $T,V,N$):**

$$
\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle = \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \beta^{2}}\ln Z = k_{B}T^{2}\,C_{V}
$$

Relative size shrinks as $\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle^{1/2}/U \sim 1/\sqrt{N}$ for normal systems.

**Grand canonical (fixed $T,V,\mu$):**

$$
\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V}
$$

Equivalently, in terms of density $n=N/V$ and isothermal compressibility $\kappa_{T} \equiv -\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T,N}$,

$$
\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = N\,k_{B}T\,n\,\kappa_{T}
$$

for a single-component fluid where $dn = \chi_{\mu}\,d\mu$ and standard thermodynamic identities have been used.

---

### 9.4.2 Volume fluctuations at fixed pressure

Holding $(T,p,N)$ fixed, the isothermal–isobaric partition function $\Delta$ generates

$$
\langle(\Delta V)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T,N} = k_{B}T\,V\,\kappa_{T}
$$

Again, **fluctuation = response**: compressibility measures how much $V$ wiggles when $p$ nudges; that same coefficient sets the equilibrium variance.

---

### 9.4.3 Static fluctuation–response in one line

Let a control $\lambda$ couple to an observable $X$ via $H \to H - \lambda X$ (so $X=-\partial H/\partial \lambda$). In the canonical ensemble,

$$
\chi_{XX} \equiv \left(\frac{\partial \langle X\rangle}{\partial \lambda}\right)_{T,V,N} = \beta\,\langle(\Delta X)^{2}\rangle
$$

Special cases:

- $X=E$, $\lambda$ shifts $\beta$: $\chi_{EE}$ reduces to $C_{V}/T$ and reproduces $\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle=k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}$  
- $X=N$ in the grand ensemble gives $\left(\partial N/\partial \mu\right)_{T,V}=\beta\,\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle$

Positivity of variances $\Rightarrow$ **stability**: $C_{V}\ge 0$, $\kappa_{T}\ge 0$ in ensembles with fixed $T$.

---

### 9.4.4 Correlations, structure factor, and the compressibility sum rule

Define the microscopic density $\hat n(\mathbf r)=\sum_{i}\delta(\mathbf r-\mathbf r_{i})$, the pair correlation $g(\mathbf r)$, and the **static structure factor**

$$
S(\mathbf k) \equiv \frac{1}{N}\left\langle \delta \hat n_{\mathbf k}\,\delta \hat n_{-\mathbf k}\right\rangle,\qquad \delta \hat n_{\mathbf k} \equiv \int d^{3}r\, e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf r}\,[\hat n(\mathbf r)-n]
$$

In a uniform fluid,

$$
S(\mathbf k) = 1 + n \int d^{3}r\, e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf r}\,[g(\mathbf r)-1]
$$

Taking $\mathbf k\to 0$ connects **microscopic correlations** to **macroscopic response**:

$$
S(0) = n\,k_{B}T\,\kappa_{T}
$$

This is the **compressibility sum rule**. Near a critical point, $\kappa_{T}\to \infty$ and $S(0)$ spikes—aka **critical opalescence**.

---

### 9.4.5 Saddle points, curvature, and large deviations

Microcanonical entropy $S(E)$ controls fluctuations through its **curvature**. Expand around the most probable energy $E^{\ast}$:

$$
S(E) \approx S(E^{\ast}) + \frac{1}{2}(E-E^{\ast})^{2}\left(\frac{\partial^{2} S}{\partial E^{2}}\right)_{E^{\ast}}
$$

Performing the Laplace transform to the canonical ensemble gives a Gaussian for $E$ with variance $( -k_{B}/S'' )$, equivalent to $k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}$. More generally, additive observables obey a **large-deviation principle**:

$$
\mathbb P\!\left(\frac{A}{N}\approx a\right)\sim e^{-N I(a)}
$$

where $I(a)\ge 0$ is the **rate function** (Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function). At first-order transitions the relevant thermodynamic potential develops multiple competing saddles → **non-Gaussian** fluctuations and phase coexistence.

---

### 9.4.6 Critical fluctuations and correlation length

Let $\phi$ be an order parameter (e.g., magnetization density). Define the connected correlator

$$
G(\mathbf r) \equiv \langle \phi(\mathbf r)\phi(\mathbf 0)\rangle_{c}
$$

Away from criticality,

$$
G(\mathbf r) \sim \frac{e^{-r/\xi}}{r^{d-2+\eta}}
$$

with finite correlation length $\xi$. The static susceptibility $\chi \equiv \int d^{d}r\, G(\mathbf r)$ scales as

$$
\chi \sim \xi^{2-\eta}
$$

Therefore, in a volume $V$, the variance of the spatially averaged order parameter scales like $\mathrm{Var}(\bar\phi) \sim \chi/V$. When $\xi$ is finite, relative fluctuations $\sim 1/\sqrt{V}$. As $T\to T_{c}$, $\xi\to\infty$ and the $1/\sqrt{N}$ law **breaks down**.

---

### 9.4.7 Finite-size scaling: when N is large but not infinite

- For **noncritical** systems: $\mathrm{Var}(A) \propto N$ for additive $A$ → relative size $\propto N^{-1/2}$.  
- Near criticality: with $\xi$ comparable to system size $L$, replace $\xi$ by $L$ in scaling formulas; peaks in specific heat or susceptibility **round** and **shift** with $L$ in predictable ways (used to extract critical exponents numerically).

---

### 9.4.8 Example: noninteracting paramagnet and Curie law

$N$ spins $s=\tfrac12$ in field $B$ with Hamiltonian $H=-\mu B\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}$, $\sigma_{i}=\pm 1$. The single-spin partition function is $z=2\cosh(\beta\mu B)$, magnetization per spin

$$
m \equiv \frac{\langle M\rangle}{N} = \mu\,\tanh(\beta\mu B)
$$

Variance of $M$ is binomial:

$$
\langle(\Delta M)^{2}\rangle = N\,\mu^{2}\,\mathrm{sech}^{2}(\beta\mu B)
$$

Static susceptibility $\chi \equiv \left(\partial \langle M\rangle/\partial B\right)_{T}$ matches fluctuation–response:

$$
\chi = \beta\,\langle(\Delta M)^{2}\rangle = \frac{N\mu^{2}}{k_{B}T}\,\mathrm{sech}^{2}(\beta\mu B)
$$

In the weak-field limit, Curie law:

$$
\chi \approx \frac{N\mu^{2}}{k_{B}T}
$$

---

### 9.4.9 Example: ideal gas density fluctuations and S(0)

In a classical ideal gas, particles are uncorrelated: $g(\mathbf r)=1$. Then $S(\mathbf k)=1$ for all $\mathbf k$ and

$$
S(0) = 1 = n\,k_{B}T\,\kappa_{T}
$$

so $\kappa_{T}=1/(n k_{B}T)$, the ideal-gas result. Number variance in a subvolume $V'$ is **Poissonian**: $\langle(\Delta N')^{2}\rangle=\langle N'\rangle$.

---

### 9.4.10 Common pitfalls

- **Mixing ensembles.** Don’t use canonical $C_{V}$ with grand-canonical number fluctuations unless you’ve matched the ensemble to the measurement.  
- **Forcing Gaussian fits near transitions.** At first order, distributions are bimodal (two phases); at criticality, power-law tails win.  
- **Ignoring constraints.** Conserved totals suppress variances (e.g., fixed total $N$ reduces subvolume fluctuations).  
- **Calling negative $C_{V}$ “instability.”** In microcanonical small systems with long-range forces, $C_{V}<0$ can appear; it signals ensemble inequivalence, not algebra failure.

---

### 9.4.11 Worked mini-examples

**(a) $N\!pT$ volume variance**  
From $\Delta=\int dV\,e^{-\beta pV}Z$, show $\langle(\Delta V)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\,V\,\kappa_{T}$ and verify it for an ideal gas.

**(b) Compressibility sum rule**  
Starting with $S(\mathbf k)=1+n\int d^{3}r\,e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r}[g(r)-1]$, take $\mathbf k\to 0$ and use thermodynamics to derive $S(0)=n k_{B}T\kappa_{T}$.

**(c) Energy large deviations**  
From $Z=\int dE\,e^{S(E)/k_{B}-\beta E}$, do the quadratic expansion and read off $\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle$; identify when the Gaussian approximation fails.

**(d) Paramagnet variance → Curie**  
Compute $\langle M\rangle$ and $\langle M^{2}\rangle$ from $z$ and show $\chi=\beta\langle(\Delta M)^{2}\rangle$; take $B\to 0$ to get $\chi\propto 1/T$.

**(e) Subvolume fluctuations**  
For an ideal gas, partition a box into two volumes $V'$ and $V-V'$. With fixed total $N$, show $\mathrm{Var}(N')=N(V'/V)(1-V'/V)$ (binomial), contrasting with grand-canonical Poisson variance.

---

### 9.4.12 Minimal problem kit

- Prove the general static relation $\chi_{XX}=\beta\langle(\Delta X)^{2}\rangle$ from derivatives of $\ln Z$ with a source term  
- Derive $\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\left(\partial N/\partial\mu\right)_{T,V}$ and connect it to $\kappa_{T}$ for a single-component fluid  
- Show that $S(0)=n k_{B}T\kappa_{T}$ implies $S(0)\to\infty$ as a liquid approaches its gas–liquid critical point and explain “critical opalescence” qualitatively  
- Using a Landau $\phi^{4}$ free energy $f=a(T-T_{c})\phi^{2}+b\phi^{4}$, compute Gaussian fluctuations above $T_{c}$ and extract $\chi\propto 1/(T-T_{c})$ at mean-field level  
- For a lattice model with conserved order parameter, discuss how conservation modifies long-time relaxation (but not equal-time static variances) at fixed $T$

---

**In summary:** Equilibrium fluctuations aren’t noise—they’re **thermometers**. Variances of $E$, $N$, $V$, $M$ equal the corresponding response coefficients times $k_{B}T$; pair correlations feed macroscopic compressibility; and curvature of thermodynamic potentials sets Gaussian widths until phase transitions wreck the approximation. Away from criticality, $1/\sqrt{N}$ keeps the macroscopic world calm; near a critical point, correlation length and susceptibilities blow up and fluctuations take center stage


## 9.5 Quantum Gases: Bose & Fermi Statistics, Polylogs, and the Road to Degeneracy

Classical MB stats are great… until $n\lambda_{T}^{3}$ isn’t tiny. Then indistinguishability and exchange symmetry flip the table. This section derives Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac from the grand ensemble, computes thermodynamics with polylog functions, connects to the classical limit via virial expansions, and builds the degenerate Fermi-gas toolkit including the Sommerfeld expansion. We also map how the chemical potential moves with $T$ and $n$.

---

### 9.5.1 Grand ensemble → BE/FD distributions

Put noninteracting identical particles in the grand canonical ensemble at $(T,V,\mu)$. With fugacity $z\equiv e^{\beta \mu}$ and one–particle levels $\{\epsilon_{\alpha}\}$,

$$
\ln \Xi = \pm \sum_{\alpha}\ln\!\left(1 \mp z\,e^{-\beta\epsilon_{\alpha}}\right)
$$

upper sign for bosons, lower for fermions. Occupations are

$$
\langle n_{\alpha}\rangle = \frac{1}{z^{-1}e^{\beta\epsilon_{\alpha}} \mp 1}
$$

The minus in the denominator gives **Bose–Einstein** bunching, the plus gives **Fermi–Dirac** blocking.

---

### 9.5.2 Density of states in 3D and continuum replacement

For spin degeneracy $g$ and nonrelativistic dispersion $\epsilon=\mathbf p^{2}/2m$ in volume $V$,

$$
g(\epsilon)\,d\epsilon = g\,\frac{V}{4\pi^{2}}\left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^{2}}\right)^{3/2}\sqrt{\epsilon}\,d\epsilon
$$

Sums become integrals $\sum_{\alpha}\to \int d\epsilon\,g(\epsilon)$.

Define the thermal wavelength

$$
\lambda_{T} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{2\pi \hbar^{2}}{m k_{B} T}}
$$

and the polylogarithm $\operatorname{Li}_{s}(x) \equiv \sum_{k\ge1} x^{k}/k^{s}$.

---

### 9.5.3 Polylog thermodynamics: N, U, and p

For both bosons and fermions, results compactify via polylogs. Let

$$
g_{s}(z) \equiv \operatorname{Li}_{s}(z),\qquad f_{s}(z) \equiv -\,\operatorname{Li}_{s}(-z)
$$

Then in $d=3$ for a uniform nonrelativistic gas,

- **Bosons** $(\text{BE})$

$$
N = \frac{gV}{\lambda_{T}^{3}}\,g_{3/2}(z),\qquad 
p = \frac{g k_{B}T}{\lambda_{T}^{3}}\,g_{5/2}(z),\qquad 
U = \frac{3}{2}\,pV
$$

- **Fermions** $(\text{FD})$

$$
N = \frac{gV}{\lambda_{T}^{3}}\,f_{3/2}(z),\qquad 
p = \frac{g k_{B}T}{\lambda_{T}^{3}}\,f_{5/2}(z),\qquad 
U = \frac{3}{2}\,pV
$$

The virial identity $U=\tfrac{3}{2}pV$ holds for any ideal nonrelativistic gas with quadratic dispersion.

---

### 9.5.4 Classical limit and the first quantum correction

When $z\ll 1$ (high $T$ or low $n$), both stats reduce to MB since $g_{s}(z)\approx z$ and $f_{s}(z)\approx z$. Expanding further gives the leading quantum correction to the ideal–gas law

$$
\frac{p}{n k_{B}T} = 1 \pm \frac{1}{2^{5/2}}\,n\,\lambda_{T}^{3} + \mathcal O\!\left((n\lambda_{T}^{3})^{2}\right)
$$

upper sign for **fermions** (Pauli “repulsion” raises pressure), lower sign for **bosons** (Bose “attraction” lowers it)

---

### 9.5.5 Chemical potential behavior

- **Bosons**: $\mu \le 0$. At fixed $n$ as $T$ decreases, $\mu$ rises toward $0^{-}$. For an ideal uniform gas, the excited-state capacity is capped by $g_{3/2}(1)=\zeta(3/2)$, leading to Bose–Einstein condensation when $n\lambda_{T}^{3}$ exceeds a constant. We detail BEC in §9.7.
- **Fermions**: $\mu$ is positive at low $T$ and approaches the **Fermi energy** $\epsilon_{F}$ as $T\to 0$. With $n\equiv N/V$ and spin degeneracy $g$,

$$
\epsilon_{F} = \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left(\frac{6\pi^{2} n}{g}\right)^{2/3},\qquad 
k_{B}T_{F} \equiv \epsilon_{F}
$$

At finite but small $T/T_{F}$, $\mu(T)$ decreases from $\epsilon_{F}$ by $\sim (T/T_{F})^{2}$.

---

### 9.5.6 Degenerate Fermi gas and the Sommerfeld expansion

For $T\ll T_{F}$, evaluate Fermi integrals asymptotically. Let $x\equiv T/T_{F}\ll 1$.

- **Chemical potential**

$$
\mu(T) = \epsilon_{F}\left[1 - \frac{\pi^{2}}{12}x^{2} - \frac{\pi^{4}}{80}x^{4} + \cdots\right]
$$

- **Internal energy and pressure at low $T$**

$$
U = \frac{3}{5}N\epsilon_{F}\left[1 + \frac{5\pi^{2}}{12}x^{2} + \cdots\right],\qquad 
p = \frac{2}{5} n \epsilon_{F}\left[1 + \frac{5\pi^{2}}{12}x^{2} + \cdots\right]
$$

- **Heat capacity per particle**

$$
\frac{C_{V}}{N k_{B}} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{2}\,x + \mathcal O(x^{3})
$$

Linear in $T$ is the signature of a Fermi surface with a thin shell of thermally active states of thickness $\sim k_{B}T$.

---

### 9.5.7 Nondegenerate Bose gas and the edge of BEC

Above condensation (no macroscopic ground-state occupation), $\mu<0$ solves $n\lambda_{T}^{3} = g\,g_{3/2}(z)$. Thermodynamics follows from §9.5.3 with $z<1$. As $T$ is lowered at fixed $n$, $z\to 1^{-}$, $g_{s}(z)\to \zeta(s)$, and the excited-state density saturates at

$$
n_{\text{ex,max}} = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^{3}}\,\zeta(3/2)
$$

The “excess” particles must go into the ground state at and below the critical temperature found in §9.7.

---

### 9.5.8 Relativistic and massless limits (teaser)

For $\epsilon=pc$ or $\epsilon=\sqrt{p^{2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4}}$, the density of states changes to $g(\epsilon)\propto \epsilon^{2}$ and $U\propto VT^{4}$ for massless bosons (photons), with $p=U/3V$. We develop photons and phonons in §9.6.

---

### 9.5.9 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Classical limit check**

Show that taking $z\ll 1$ in $N = gV\lambda_{T}^{-3} g_{3/2}(z)$ and $p = g k_{B}T \lambda_{T}^{-3} g_{5/2}(z)$ reproduces $pV=Nk_{B}T$ to leading order and yields the $\pm 2^{-5/2} n\lambda_{T}^{3}$ correction next.

**(b) 3D density of states**

Derive $g(\epsilon)$ by counting momentum states in a box and using $\epsilon=\mathbf p^{2}/2m$.

**(c) Fermi energy numerics**

For electrons in a metal with $n\approx 8.5\times 10^{28}\ \mathrm{m}^{-3}$ and $g=2$, compute $\epsilon_{F}$ and $T_{F}$, then estimate $C_{V}/(Nk_{B})$ at $T=300\ \mathrm{K}$.

**(d) Low-$T$ $\mu(T)$ for fermions**

Use the Sommerfeld expansion of $\int d\epsilon\,\epsilon^{1/2}/(e^{\beta(\epsilon-\mu)}+1)$ to obtain the $\mu(T)$ series up to $\mathcal O(x^{4})$.

**(e) Bose gas near $z\to 1^{-}$**

Evaluate $g_{3/2}(z)$ numerically close to $z=1$ using the polylog expansion and show how $n\lambda_{T}^{3}$ approaches $g\,\zeta(3/2)$.

---

### 9.5.10 Minimal problem kit

- Starting from $\ln\Xi$, derive $\langle n_{\alpha}\rangle$ and the BE/FD forms  
- Replace sums by $\int d\epsilon\,g(\epsilon)$ to obtain the polylog formulas for $N$, $p$, and $U$ in $d=3$  
- Expand $p/(n k_{B}T)$ in powers of $n\lambda_{T}^{3}$ and identify the second virial coefficient sign for bosons vs fermions  
- Derive the Fermi energy $\epsilon_{F}$ and $p(T=0)=\tfrac{2}{5}n\epsilon_{F}$, then use Sommerfeld to obtain $C_{V}\propto T$  
- At fixed $n$ for an ideal Bose gas, show $\mu\to 0^{-}$ as $T\downarrow T_{c}$ and compute the slope $d\mu/dT$ at $z\lesssim 1$ from the number equation

---

**In summary:** Quantum gases swap MB’s “independent coins” for exchange-correlated dice. Polylogs make the algebra one-liners; virial corrections expose quantum statistics in the classical limit; fermions freeze into a Fermi sea with $C_{V}\propto T$; bosons stack toward $z\to 1^{-}$ and run out of excited-state room—the prelude to condensation in §9.7

## 9.6 Photons & Phonons: Blackbody Radiation and Heat Capacity of Solids

Two archetypal Bose gases, two very different worlds. **Photons**: massless, spin-1, number not conserved, $\mu=0$, pressure $p=U/3V$, the $T^{4}$ law. **Phonons**: lattice vibrations with linear dispersion at long wavelengths, three polarizations, and a Debye cutoff that enforces $3N$ modes. Together they explain the spectrum of light and why solids’ specific heats crash to zero at low $T$.

---

### 9.6.1 Photon gas basics

Photons are created/annihilated freely in thermal equilibrium, so the chemical potential **must** be zero. Put EM waves in a large cubic cavity of volume $V$ with periodic boundary conditions. Counting transverse modes per angular frequency $\omega$ gives the density of states

$$
g(\omega)\,d\omega = \frac{V}{\pi^{2}c^{3}}\,\omega^{2}\,d\omega
$$

Bose occupation with $\mu=0$ is $n_{B}(\omega)=\left(e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1\right)^{-1}$, yielding the **Planck energy density**

$$
u(\omega)\,d\omega \equiv \frac{U}{V} = \frac{\hbar\omega^{3}}{\pi^{2}c^{3}}\;\frac{d\omega}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1}
$$

The **number** spectrum follows by dividing by $\hbar\omega$

$$
n(\omega)\,d\omega = \frac{\omega^{2}}{\pi^{2}c^{3}}\;\frac{d\omega}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1}
$$

---

### 9.6.2 Stefan–Boltzmann and Wien: two famous corollaries

Integrating $u(\omega)$ over all $\omega$ gives

$$
\frac{U}{V} \equiv a\,T^{4},\qquad a = \frac{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{4}}{15\,\hbar^{3}c^{3}}
$$

Radiation pressure for an isotropic photon gas is

$$
p = \frac{1}{3}\,\frac{U}{V}
$$

The **radiative flux** from a black surface is $\Phi=\sigma T^{4}$ with

$$
\sigma = \frac{a c}{4} = \frac{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{4}}{60\,\hbar^{3}c^{2}}
$$

The wavelength of peak spectral exitance satisfies **Wien’s displacement**

$$
\lambda_{\text{max}}\,T = b,\qquad b \approx 2.898\times 10^{-3}\ \text{m}\cdot\text{K}
$$

obtained by maximizing the $\lambda$-form of Planck’s law.

Entropy density and enthalpy follow from $p=U/3V$:

$$
s \equiv \frac{S}{V} = \frac{4}{3}aT^{3},\qquad h \equiv \frac{U+pV}{V} = \frac{4}{3}aT^{4}
$$

---

### 9.6.3 Phonons: quantized sound with linear dispersion

In a crystal, small lattice displacements form normal modes. At long wavelengths the **acoustic** branches have

$$
\omega = v_{s}\,k
$$

with sound speed $v_{s}$ and three polarizations (one longitudinal, two transverse). Treating them as a gas of noninteracting bosons, the Bose occupation is the same $n_{B}(\omega)$, but the density of states uses $v_{s}$ instead of $c$ and must be **cut off** to enforce a finite number of modes.

Debye’s key move: approximate the acoustic branches as linear up to a cutoff $k_{D}$ chosen so that the **total number of modes equals $3N$** for $N$ atoms

$$
\frac{V}{2\pi^{2}}\int_{0}^{k_{D}} k^{2}\,dk\times 3 = 3N \;\Rightarrow\; k_{D} = \left(6\pi^{2}\frac{N}{V}\right)^{1/3}
$$

Define the **Debye frequency** and **Debye temperature**

$$
\omega_{D} \equiv v_{s}\,k_{D},\qquad \Theta_{D} \equiv \frac{\hbar\omega_{D}}{k_{B}}
$$

A single “average” $v_{s}$ captures the three polarizations to good accuracy for bulk thermodynamics.

---

### 9.6.4 Debye model

The phonon internal energy omitting zero-point pieces is

$$
U = \int_{0}^{\omega_{D}} d\omega\; g_{D}(\omega)\,\hbar\omega\,n_{B}(\omega)
$$

with Debye density of states

$$
g_{D}(\omega) = \frac{9N}{\omega_{D}^{3}}\,\omega^{2}
$$

Change variables $x \equiv \hbar\omega/k_{B}T$ to obtain the standard Debye heat capacity

$$
C_{V} = 9N k_{B}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right)^{3} \int_{0}^{\Theta_{D}/T} dx\; \frac{x^{4} e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}
$$

Asymptotics:

- **Low $T$** $\left(T\ll \Theta_{D}\right)$

$$
C_{V} \simeq \frac{12\pi^{4}}{5}\,N k_{B}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right)^{3}
$$

- **High $T$** $\left(T\gg \Theta_{D}\right)$

$$
C_{V} \to 3N k_{B}
$$

recovering Dulong–Petit.

---

### 9.6.5 Einstein model: optical modes and the crossover

Einstein imagined each atom as an independent oscillator of a single frequency $\omega_{E}$. Then

$$
C_{V}^{\text{Ein}} = 3N k_{B}\;\frac{x^{2} e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}},\qquad x \equiv \frac{\hbar\omega_{E}}{k_{B}T}
$$

It captures the **high-$T$** limit and the **exponential** freeze-out at low $T$, but misses the **$T^{3}$** law because it lacks low-frequency acoustic modes. Real crystals often interpolate: optical modes look Einstein-like, acoustic modes look Debye-like.

### 9.6.6 Phonon gas thermodynamics

With $\omega=v_{s}k$ and three polarizations, the **energy density** of a free phonon gas at low $T\ll \Theta_{D}$ mirrors photons with $c\to v_{s}$ and an extra factor $3$ from polarizations

$$
u_{\text{ph}}(T) \propto \frac{(k_{B}T)^{4}}{\hbar^{3} v_{s}^{3}}
$$

Differentiating gives $C_{V}\propto T^{3}$ as in Debye. In a solid, the “pressure” of phonons modifies the elastic response rather than pushing on a volume like a gas, but the scaling intuition is identical.

### 9.6.7 Blackbodies in nature: quick tour

- **Cosmic microwave background** is a near-perfect blackbody at $T\approx 2.725\ \text{K}$, a fossil photon gas filling the universe  
- **Stars** approximate blackbodies over parts of their spectrum; deviations encode atmospheres and lines  
- **Laboratory cavities** with small apertures mimic blackbody emitters and set radiometry standards

### 9.6.8 Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting $\mu=0$ for photons.** Any attempt to fix photon **number** in equilibrium is unphysical unless you also constrain the spectrum with pumping  
- **Mixing $\omega$ and $\lambda$ peaks.** The maximum of $u_{\omega}$ and of $u_{\lambda}$ occur at different places; Wien’s $b$ refers to the **wavelength** peak  
- **Ignoring polarizations or cutoffs.** Debye needs $3N$ modes total; missing the factor 3 or the cutoff breaks $C_{V}$  
- **High-$T$ limit with quantum units.** Always check $\Theta_{D}/T$ or $x=\hbar\omega/k_{B}T$ before claiming “classical” behavior

### 9.6.9 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Recover Stefan–Boltzmann.**  
Integrate $u(\omega)$ using $\int_{0}^{\infty} dx\,x^{3}/(e^{x}-1)=\pi^{4}/15$ after $x=\beta\hbar\omega$ to obtain $U/V=aT^{4}$ and $p=U/3V$.

**(b) Wien’s displacement.**  
Maximize the wavelength spectral density to show $\lambda_{\text{max}}T=b$ and extract $b$ numerically from the transcendental equation.

**(c) Debye low-$T$ asymptotic.**  
Expand the Debye integral for $\Theta_{D}/T\to\infty$ to derive $C_{V}\simeq(12\pi^{4}/5)N k_{B}(T/\Theta_{D})^{3}$.

**(d) Einstein vs Debye at intermediate $T$.**  
Plot $C_{V}/(3Nk_{B})$ vs $T/\Theta$ for both models and explain why real data usually bends between them.

**(e) Photon gas entropy density.**  
Using $p=U/3V$ and $dU=TdS-p\,dV$, derive $s=(4/3)aT^{3}$.

### 9.6.10 Minimal problem kit

- Starting from the cavity mode count, derive $g(\omega)$ and Planck’s $u(\omega)$  
- Prove $p=U/3V$ by averaging the Maxwell stress tensor for isotropic radiation  
- Show that the phonon mode count with Debye cutoff equals $3N$ and obtain $k_{D}$  
- Evaluate the Debye heat capacity integral numerically for $T/\Theta_{D}=\{0.05,0.2,1,3\}$ and compare to Einstein’s prediction at the same $T$ using $\omega_{E}\approx 0.806\,\omega_{D}$  
- Derive the $T^{4}$ scaling of the low-$T$ phonon energy density by mapping the photon calculation with $c\to v_{s}$

**In summary:** Photons are the cleanest Bose gas—no chemical potential, universal $T^{4}$ energy, pressure $U/3V$, and a spectrum set by Planck’s law. Phonons are quantized sound; with a Debye cutoff they produce the celebrated $C_{V}\propto T^{3}$ at low $T$ and Dulong–Petit at high $T$. Between them, light and lattice teach the same lesson: count modes right, feed them Bose factors, and thermodynamics falls out on the first try
