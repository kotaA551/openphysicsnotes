# Chapter 9: Statistical physics

## 9.1 Foundations: From Microstates to Thermodynamics

Statistical physics is the art of predicting **macroscopic** laws from **microscopic** uncertainty. We never know the exact $10^{23}$-body state; instead we organize ignorance into **ensembles** whose averages reproduce temperature, pressure, magnetization, and friends. This section builds the core: microstates vs macrostates, the fundamental postulate, the three standard ensembles, and the thermodynamic limit. We also show how the **information-theoretic** view turns “maximum entropy” into the unique engine behind the familiar distributions.

---

### 9.1.1 Microstates, macrostates, and phase space

A **microstate** is a complete specification of the system’s degrees of freedom. For $N$ classical point particles, it is a point in $6N$-dimensional **phase space** with coordinates

$$
\Gamma \equiv (\mathbf r_{1},\dots,\mathbf r_{N};\mathbf p_{1},\dots,\mathbf p_{N})
$$

A **macrostate** is defined by a few bulk variables, e.g., $(E,V,N)$ for an isolated gas. Many microstates map to the same macrostate. Counting how many leads to entropy.

Liouville’s theorem states that Hamiltonian flow is **incompressible** in phase space, so volume elements are preserved along trajectories. This makes uniform distributions over energy shells dynamically consistent.

---

### 9.1.2 Fundamental postulate and Boltzmann’s principle

**Fundamental postulate.** For an isolated system with fixed $(E,V,N)$ at equilibrium, all microstates compatible with these constraints are **equally likely**.

Let $\Omega(E,V,N)$ be the number of microstates with energies in $[E,E+\delta E]$ for a small but macroscopic $\delta E$. Then the **entropy** is

$$
S(E,V,N) = k_{B}\,\ln \Omega(E,V,N)
$$

Thermodynamic temperature follows from

$$
\frac{1}{T} = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial E}\right)_{V,N}
$$

and pressure and chemical potential are

$$
\frac{p}{T} = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{E,N},\qquad -\,\frac{\mu}{T} = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial N}\right)_{E,V}
$$

For weakly interacting subsystems $A$ and $B$, additivity of $S$ at fixed total $E$ yields the equilibrium condition $T_{A}=T_{B}$ by maximizing $S_{A}(E_{A})+S_{B}(E_{B})$ subject to $E_{A}+E_{B}=E$.

---

### 9.1.3 Thermodynamic limit, extensivity, and concavity

Define the **thermodynamic limit** as $N\to\infty$, $V\to\infty$ with $n=N/V$ fixed. In this limit:

- Entropy becomes **extensive**: $S(\lambda E,\lambda V,\lambda N)\approx \lambda S(E,V,N)$  
- $S$ is **concave** in its natural variables, ensuring stability and positive heat capacities where appropriate  
- Fluctuations of **intensive** variables shrink like $1/\sqrt{N}$, making thermodynamics sharp

Short-range interactions guarantee ensemble equivalence; long-range cases (self-gravity, unscreened Coulomb) can violate additivity and need care.

---

### 9.1.4 Microcanonical ensemble

The microcanonical density is uniform on the constant-energy hypersurface:

$$
\rho_{\text{mc}}(\Gamma) = \frac{1}{\Omega(E,V,N)}\,\delta\!\left(H(\Gamma)-E\right)
$$

Expectations are

$$
\langle A\rangle_{\text{mc}} = \frac{1}{\Omega}\int d\Gamma\;A(\Gamma)\,\delta\!\left(H(\Gamma)-E\right)
$$

Maximizing $S=k_{B}\ln\Omega$ subject to constraints reproduces thermodynamic relations. For many systems this is the conceptual anchor; in practice the canonical ensemble is often easier to compute with and becomes equivalent at large $N$.

---

### 9.1.5 Canonical ensemble via a heat bath

Place system $S$ weakly coupled to a huge reservoir $R$ with fixed $E_{\text{tot}}$. The probability that $S$ is found in microstate $i$ with energy $E_{i}$ is proportional to the number of reservoir states at energy $E_{\text{tot}}-E_{i}$:

$$
P(i) \propto \Omega_{R}(E_{\text{tot}}-E_{i}) \approx \exp\!\left[\frac{1}{k_{B}}\,S_{R}(E_{\text{tot}})-\frac{E_{i}}{k_{B}T}\right] \propto e^{-\beta E_{i}}
$$

with inverse temperature $\beta \equiv 1/(k_{B}T)$. Normalize to get

$$
P(i) = \frac{e^{-\beta E_{i}}}{Z},\qquad Z(\beta,V,N) \equiv \sum_{i} e^{-\beta E_{i}}
$$

$Z$ is the **partition function**. Thermodynamic potentials follow:

$$
F(T,V,N) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln Z
$$

$$
U = \langle E\rangle = -\,\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\ln Z
$$

$$
S = -\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\right)_{V,N} = k_{B}\left(\ln Z + \beta U\right)
$$

Energy fluctuations satisfy

$$
\langle (\Delta E)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}
$$

so relative fluctuations scale as $1/\sqrt{N}$ for normal systems.

---

### 9.1.6 Grand canonical ensemble: exchanging particles

If both energy and particles exchange with a reservoir, the probability of microstate $i$ with $(E_{i},N_{i})$ is

$$
P(i) = \frac{e^{-\beta(E_{i}-\mu N_{i})}}{\Xi}
$$

with **grand partition function**

$$
\Xi(\beta,V,\mu) \equiv \sum_{N=0}^{\infty}\sum_{i\in N} e^{-\beta(E_{i}-\mu N)}
$$

Define the grand potential

$$
\Phi_{G}(T,V,\mu) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln \Xi
$$

Then

$$
p = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\mu},\quad N = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V},\quad S = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial T}\right)_{V,\mu}
$$

Fluctuations:

$$
\langle (\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V}
$$

and energy–number covariances come from mixed derivatives of $\ln \Xi$.

---

### 9.1.7 Legendre transforms and thermodynamic potentials

Thermodynamics is organized by Legendre transforms that swap natural variables:

- $S=S(E,V,N)$  
- $F=U-TS$ with natural variables $(T,V,N)$  
- $G=F+pV$ with $(T,p,N)$  
- $H=U+pV$ with $(S,p,N)$  
- $\Phi_{G}=F-\mu N$ with $(T,V,\mu)$

Maxwell relations follow from equality of mixed partial derivatives, e.g.,

$$
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} = \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}
$$

---

### 9.1.8 Information-theoretic foundation (Jaynes view)

Let $\{p_{i}\}$ be probabilities over microstates. **Maximize** the Shannon entropy

$$
\mathcal S[p] \equiv -k_{B}\sum_{i} p_{i}\ln p_{i}
$$

subject to known constraints. With only normalization and mean energy fixed, Lagrange multipliers give

$$
p_{i} = \frac{e^{-\beta E_{i}}}{Z}
$$

With energy and particle number constraints, one obtains the grand canonical form $p_{i}\propto e^{-\beta(E_{i}-\mu N_{i})}$. Thus ensembles are the **least biased** distributions compatible with macroscopic data.

Relative entropy $D(p\Vert q)=\sum p_{i}\ln(p_{i}/q_{i})\ge 0$ measures distance to a prior $q$. Many fluctuation theorems and linear-response results are compact in this language.

---

### 9.1.9 Large deviations, concentration, and ensemble equivalence

For $N\gg 1$, probabilities concentrate exponentially near thermodynamic values. If $A$ is an additive observable,

$$
\mathbb P\!\left(\frac{A}{N}\approx a\right)\sim e^{-N\,I(a)}
$$

with a **rate function** $I(a)\ge 0$ that vanishes at the equilibrium value. Under standard convexity conditions:

- Microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles are **equivalent** in the thermodynamic limit  
- Nonconcavities signal phase coexistence; Maxwell constructions repair them at the level of thermodynamic potentials

---

### 9.1.10 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Two-level system**  
Energy levels $0$ and $\epsilon$ for $N$ noninteracting sites. Canonical partition function per site

$$
z = 1 + e^{-\beta\epsilon}
$$

Total $Z=z^{N}$. Average energy $U=N\,\epsilon/(e^{\beta\epsilon}+1)$ and heat capacity shows a Schottky peak near $k_{B}T\sim \epsilon$.

**(b) Classical harmonic oscillator**  
Single oscillator with $E_{n}=(n+\tfrac12)\hbar\omega$ gives

$$
Z = \frac{e^{-\beta\hbar\omega/2}}{1-e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}}
$$

Average energy $U=\frac{\hbar\omega}{2}+\frac{\hbar\omega}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1}$ tends to $k_{B}T$ at high $T$ (equipartition) and to $\hbar\omega/2$ at $T\to 0$.

**(c) Coin toss and Stirling**  
For $N$ independent fair coins, the multiplicity of $k$ heads is $\binom{N}{k}\approx \exp\!\left[N\,H(k/N)\right]/\sqrt{2\pi N x(1-x)}$ with $x=k/N$ and binary entropy $H(x)=-x\ln x-(1-x)\ln(1-x)$. This is the large-deviation archetype.

**(d) Ideal gas microcanonical temperature**  
For a classical ideal gas, counting states yields

$$
\Omega(E,V,N) \propto \frac{V^{N}E^{\tfrac{3N}{2}-1}}{N!\,\Gamma\!\left(\tfrac{3N}{2}\right)}
$$

so $S=k_{B}\ln\Omega$ gives $U=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T$ and $pV=Nk_{B}T$ after Stirling.

**(e) Canonical fluctuations**  
Show $\langle (\Delta E)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}$ by taking $\partial^{2}_{\beta}\ln Z$ and relate the heat capacity to curvature of $\ln Z$.

---

### 9.1.11 Minimal problem kit

- Starting from $S=k_{B}\ln\Omega$, derive $1/T=(\partial S/\partial E)_{V,N}$ and $p/T=(\partial S/\partial V)_{E,N}$  
- Derive the canonical ensemble by maximizing $\mathcal S[p]$ with constraints $\sum p_{i}=1$ and $\sum p_{i}E_{i}=U$  
- Show that $F=-k_{B}T\ln Z$ implies $S=-\partial F/\partial T$ and $p=-\partial F/\partial V$  
- For a classical ideal gas, compute $\Omega(E,V,N)$ up to a constant using phase-space volume and obtain the Sackur–Tetrode entropy  
- Prove $\langle (\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\,(\partial N/\partial\mu)_{T,V}$ in the grand canonical ensemble  
- Discuss when ensemble equivalence fails and give a physical example with long-range forces

---

**In summary:** Microstates live in phase space; macrostates live in a few variables. Equiprobability on the energy shell plus counting delivers $S=k_{B}\ln\Omega$. Coupling to reservoirs yields the canonical and grand canonical ensembles, with partition functions generating all thermodynamics. In the thermodynamic limit, fluctuations shrink, ensembles agree, and entropy’s concavity secures stability. Information-theoretic maximum entropy ties it together as the unique, least-biased inference consistent with macroscopic data.


## 9.2 Partition Functions & Thermodynamic Potentials

Partition functions are the generators of everything thermodynamic. Once you have $Z$ or $\Xi$ or the $N\!pT$ analogue, derivatives give you $U,p,S,\mu$ and all the response coefficients. This section builds the canonical and grand-canonical machinery, adds the isothermal–isobaric ensemble, and shows how Legendre transforms and saddle points tie them back to microcanonical entropy. Worked examples anchor the formulas.

---

### 9.2.1 Canonical partition function and cumulants

For fixed $(T,V,N)$ the canonical weights are $P(i)\propto e^{-\beta E_{i}}$ with

$$
Z(\beta,V,N) \equiv \sum_{i} e^{-\beta E_{i}}
$$

Helmholtz free energy

$$
F(T,V,N) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln Z
$$

Standard derivatives

$$
U \equiv \langle E\rangle = -\,\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\ln Z
$$

$$
S = -\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\right)_{V,N} = k_{B}\left(\ln Z + \beta U\right)
$$

$$
p = -\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial V}\right)_{T,N}
$$

Energy cumulants follow from derivatives of $\ln Z$ with respect to $\beta$. For instance

$$
\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle = \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \beta^{2}}\ln Z = k_{B}T^{2} C_{V}
$$

Generalized forces for a control parameter $\lambda$ that enters $H(\lambda)$ obey

$$
\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda}\right)_{T,V,N} = \left\langle \frac{\partial H}{\partial \lambda}\right\rangle
$$

Examples: $M = -\left(\partial F/\partial B\right)_{T,V,N}$ for a magnetic field $B$ and $p = -\left(\partial F/\partial V\right)_{T,N}$ for volume.

---

### 9.2.2 Grand partition function, fugacity, and pressure

When particle number fluctuates at fixed $(T,V,\mu)$

$$
\Xi(\beta,V,\mu) \equiv \sum_{N=0}^{\infty}\sum_{i\in N} e^{-\beta(E_{i}-\mu N)}
$$

Define the grand potential

$$
\Phi_{G}(T,V,\mu) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln \Xi
$$

Thermodynamics in this ensemble is compact

$$
p = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\mu}
$$

$$
N = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V}
$$

$$
S = -\left(\frac{\partial \Phi_{G}}{\partial T}\right)_{V,\mu}
$$

It is common to use the **fugacity** $z\equiv e^{\beta \mu}$. Number fluctuations and compressibility are linked by

$$
\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V}
$$

For a uniform ideal gas one finds the handy identity $pV = k_{B}T \ln \Xi$.

---

### 9.2.3 Isothermal–isobaric ensemble and Gibbs free energy

Many experiments hold $(T,p,N)$ fixed. The isothermal–isobaric partition function is the Laplace transform of $Z$ over $V$

$$
\Delta(\beta,p,N) \equiv \int_{0}^{\infty} dV\; e^{-\beta p V}\, Z(\beta,V,N)
$$

Its thermodynamic potential is the **Gibbs free energy**

$$
G(T,p,N) \equiv -\,k_{B}T\,\ln \Delta
$$

Then

$$
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial p}\right)_{T,N} = V,\qquad
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p,N} = -S,\qquad
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial N}\right)_{T,p} = \mu
$$

Fluctuations of $V$ at fixed $(T,p,N)$ are generated by derivatives of $\ln \Delta$.

---

### 9.2.4 Legendre structure and microcanonical link

Canonical and grand-canonical ensembles are **Laplace transforms** of the microcanonical state count

$$
Z(\beta,V,N) = \int dE\; \Omega(E,V,N)\,e^{-\beta E}
$$

For large systems the integral is dominated by a saddle point $E^{\ast}$ with $\partial_{E}\ln\Omega|_{E^{\ast}}=\beta$, i.e., $1/T = \partial S/\partial E$. Evaluating at the saddle yields the Legendre relation

$$
F(T,V,N) = U - T S
$$

Similarly, the grand-canonical transform over both $E$ and $N$ yields

$$
\Phi_{G}(T,V,\mu) = U - T S - \mu N
$$

These are the reasons thermodynamic potentials are Legendre transforms of $S$.

---

### 9.2.5 Ideal classical gas in the canonical ensemble

Take $N$ indistinguishable particles of mass $m$ with Hamiltonian $H=\sum p_{i}^{2}/2m$ and ignore interactions. The canonical partition function factorizes into a translational part

$$
Z(\beta,V,N) = \frac{1}{N!}\left[\frac{V}{\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right]^{N}
$$

with thermal wavelength

$$
\lambda_{T} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{2\pi \hbar^{2}}{m k_{B} T}}
$$

Then

$$
F = -\,k_{B}T \ln Z = -\,Nk_{B}T\left[\ln\!\left(\frac{V}{N\,\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right) + 1\right]
$$

Equation of state follows immediately

$$
pV = Nk_{B}T
$$

Entropy is the Sackur–Tetrode form

$$
S = Nk_{B}\left[\ln\!\left(\frac{V}{N\,\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right) + \frac{5}{2}\right]
$$

and the internal energy is $U=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T$ with $C_{V}=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}$. The $1/N!$ cures the Gibbs paradox by enforcing indistinguishability.

---

### 9.2.6 Quantum ideal gases via the cluster expansion

For noninteracting bosons or fermions with one-particle energies $\{\epsilon_{\alpha}\}$

$$
\ln \Xi = \pm \sum_{\alpha} \ln\!\left(1 \mp z\,e^{-\beta \epsilon_{\alpha}}\right)
$$

upper sign for bosons, lower for fermions. Occupations are

$$
\langle n_{\alpha}\rangle = \frac{1}{z^{-1}e^{\beta \epsilon_{\alpha}} \mp 1}
$$

In the continuum limit one replaces $\sum_{\alpha}\to \int d\epsilon\,g(\epsilon)$ to obtain thermodynamics of photon, phonon, or electron gases. Interactions can be included perturbatively via virial or cluster expansions that correct $\ln \Xi$ by coefficients $B_{2},B_{3},\dots$.

---

### 9.2.7 Generalized forces and response matrices

If a Hamiltonian depends on external controls $\boldsymbol{\lambda}=(\lambda_{1},\dots)$, the matrix of second derivatives of $F$ gives linear response

$$
\chi_{ab} \equiv -\left(\frac{\partial^{2} F}{\partial \lambda_{a}\,\partial \lambda_{b}}\right)_{T,V,N} = \beta\,\langle \Delta X_{a}\,\Delta X_{b}\rangle
$$

where $X_{a}\equiv -\partial H/\partial \lambda_{a}$ is the conjugate observable. Examples include magnetic susceptibility, compressibility, and heat capacities. Mixed derivatives encode Maxwell relations, e.g., $\left(\partial S/\partial V\right)_{T,N}=\left(\partial p/\partial T\right)_{V,N}$.

---

### 9.2.8 Ising-like lattice systems and counting practice

For a finite lattice with spins $s_{i}=\pm 1$ and Hamiltonian $H=-J\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}s_{i}s_{j}-h\sum_{i}s_{i}$ the canonical partition function is

$$
Z(\beta,h) = \sum_{\lbrace s\rbrace} \exp\!\left[\beta J \sum_{\langle ij\rangle}s_{i}s_{j} + \beta h \sum_{i}s_{i}\right]
$$

While exact evaluation is hard beyond 1D, derivatives of $\ln Z$ still define magnetization $M=\left(\partial \ln Z/\partial (\beta h)\right)$ and susceptibility $\chi=\partial M/\partial h$. Mean-field or transfer-matrix approaches approximate $Z$ systematically.

---

### 9.2.9 Gibbs–Duhem and extensivity checks

For an extensive system with $U(S,V,N)$ homogeneous of degree one, Euler’s relation holds

$$
U = TS - pV + \mu N
$$

Differentiating yields the **Gibbs–Duhem** equation

$$
S\,dT - V\,dp + N\,d\mu = 0
$$

This is a consistency check for any equation of state you derive from a partition function.

---

### 9.2.10 Laplace tricks, saddle points, and when ensembles match

Because $Z$ and $\Delta$ are Laplace transforms, large-$N$ thermodynamics follows from their leading saddle. Concavity of $S(E,V,N)$ guarantees equivalence of ensembles. At first-order transitions $Z$ develops multiple competing saddles; Legendre transforms pick the convex envelope, and fluctuations become non-Gaussian in finite systems.

---

### 9.2.11 Worked mini-examples

**(a) $N\!pT$ ideal gas**

Compute $\Delta$ for the ideal gas using $Z=(V/\lambda_{T}^{3})^{N}/N!$ to show

$$
\Delta = \frac{1}{N!}\left(\frac{k_{B}T}{p\,\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right)^{N}
$$

and verify $G=Nk_{B}T\ln\!\left(p\,\lambda_{T}^{3}/k_{B}T\right) + Nk_{B}T$ and $V = \left(\partial G/\partial p\right)_{T,N} = Nk_{B}T/p$.

**(b) Pressure from $Z$ via the virial**

For a classical interacting gas with pair potential $u(r)$, show that $p = Nk_{B}T/V - \tfrac{2\pi n^{2}}{3}\int_{0}^{\infty} dr\, r^{3} u'(r) g(r)$ using $p=-(\partial F/\partial V)_{T,N}$ and a uniform scaling argument, where $n=N/V$ and $g(r)$ is the pair distribution.

**(c) Number fluctuations and compressibility**

In the grand ensemble, verify $\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\,\left(\partial N/\partial \mu\right)_{T,V}$ and relate to the isothermal compressibility $\kappa_{T}=\frac{1}{n^{2}}\left(\partial n/\partial \mu\right)_{T}$.

**(d) Microcanonical ↔ canonical**

Starting from $Z=\int dE\,\exp[S(E)/k_{B}-\beta E]$, perform a quadratic expansion of $S(E)$ about $E^{\ast}$ to obtain Gaussian energy fluctuations with variance $k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}$.

**(e) Two-level system free energy**

For $N$ independent two-level sites with energies $0$ and $\epsilon$, compute $Z=(1+e^{-\beta\epsilon})^{N}$, then $F$, $S$, and $C_{V}$ and locate the Schottky peak.

---

### 9.2.12 Minimal problem kit

- Derive all canonical relations for $U,S,p$ starting from $F=-k_{B}T\ln Z$ and verify the Maxwell relation $\left(\partial S/\partial V\right)_{T,N}=\left(\partial p/\partial T\right)_{V,N}$  
- Show that in the grand ensemble, $pV=k_{B}T\ln\Xi$ for an ideal gas and obtain $N$ and $S$ from derivatives of $\ln\Xi$  
- Compute the isothermal–isobaric partition function for a classical harmonic solid treated as $3N$ independent oscillators and extract $G(T,p,N)$ in the limit of weak compressibility  
- Using $\ln \Xi = \pm\sum_{\alpha}\ln(1\mp z e^{-\beta\epsilon_{\alpha}})$, recover the Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac distributions and the classical limit when $z\ll 1$  
- From extensivity, prove Euler’s relation $U=TS-pV+\mu N$ and then the Gibbs–Duhem equation, and test them on the ideal gas results above

---

**In summary:** Partition functions are the engines of thermodynamics. $Z$ gives you $F$ and all canonical data, $\Xi$ gives $\Phi_{G}$ and number fluctuations, and $\Delta$ hands you $G$ at fixed pressure. They are Laplace-transformed faces of the same microcanonical counting, glued together by Legendre transforms. Once you can push derivatives of $\ln$ partition functions with confidence, every equilibrium calculation becomes a few lines of algebra

## 9.3 Classical Ideal Gas & Equipartition

The classical ideal gas is the training montage of statistical physics: you learn to count states, take derivatives of $\ln$ partition functions, and watch macroscopic laws fall out like it’s nothing. We derive the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, prove equipartition, recover $pV=Nk_{B}T$, and build intuition for adiabats, sound speed, and when the classical picture breaks (hello, $\lambda_{T}$).

---

### 9.3.1 Canonical counting recap and the ideal-gas Z

For $N$ indistinguishable point particles of mass $m$ in volume $V$ with Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf p_{i}^{2}/2m$, the canonical partition function factorizes:

$$
Z(\beta,V,N) = \frac{1}{N!}\left[\frac{V}{\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right]^{N}
$$

with thermal wavelength

$$
\lambda_{T} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar^{2}}{m k_{B} T}}
$$

Thermodynamics then follows immediately:

$$
F = -\,Nk_{B}T\left[\ln\!\left(\frac{V}{N\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right) + 1\right],\qquad
U = \frac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T,\qquad
pV = Nk_{B}T
$$

Heat capacities:

$$
C_{V} = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{V,N} = \frac{3}{2}Nk_{B},\qquad
C_{p} = C_{V} + Nk_{B} = \frac{5}{2}Nk_{B},\qquad
\gamma \equiv \frac{C_{p}}{C_{V}} = \frac{5}{3}
$$

Entropy is the Sackur–Tetrode form:

$$
S = Nk_{B}\left[\ln\!\left(\frac{V}{N\lambda_{T}^{3}}\right) + \frac{5}{2}\right]
$$

The $1/N!$ kills the Gibbs paradox by encoding indistinguishability.

---

### 9.3.2 Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (velocities, speeds, energies)

Each momentum component is Gaussian:

$$
f(p_{x}) = \sqrt{\frac{\beta}{2\pi m}}\;\exp\!\left(-\frac{\beta p_{x}^{2}}{2m}\right)
$$

Equivalently, each velocity component is Gaussian with variance $\langle v_{x}^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T/m$. The **speed** distribution (radial in velocity space) is

$$
f(v) = 4\pi \left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_{B}T}\right)^{3/2} v^{2} \exp\!\left(-\frac{m v^{2}}{2k_{B}T}\right)
$$

Useful moments:

$$
v_{\text{mp}} = \sqrt{\frac{2k_{B}T}{m}},\qquad
\langle v\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{8k_{B}T}{\pi m}},\qquad
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}
$$

The kinetic energy distribution is $\chi^{2}$-like with $3$ degrees of freedom:

$$
f(E) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{1}{(k_{B}T)^{3/2}}\sqrt{E}\,e^{-E/k_{B}T},\qquad \langle E\rangle = \frac{3}{2}k_{B}T
$$

---

### 9.3.3 Equipartition theorem

**Statement.** Every quadratic degree of freedom in the Hamiltonian contributes $\tfrac{1}{2}k_{B}T$ to the mean energy.

**Sketch of proof (canonical, integration by parts).** If $H$ contains a term $\alpha x^{2}$, then

$$
\langle x\,\partial H/\partial x \rangle = k_{B}T
$$

For $H=\sum p_{i}^{2}/2m + \cdots$, each quadratic $p_{i}^{2}/2m$ gives $\langle p_{i}^{2}/2m\rangle = \tfrac{1}{2}k_{B}T$. A monatomic gas has $3N$ translational momenta → $U=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T$.

**When it fails (and why that’s good).** If a degree of freedom isn’t effectively quadratic (e.g., quantized rotations/vibrations at $k_{B}T$ below level spacings), equipartition “freezes out.” This explains the drop of specific heats at low $T$ and the success/failure of Dulong–Petit.

---

### 9.3.4 Kinetic-theory

From elastic impacts on a wall, the pressure can be written

$$
p = \frac{2}{3}\frac{U}{V}
$$

Combine with $U=\tfrac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T$ to get $pV=Nk_{B}T$. More generally, for pairwise interactions $u(r)$ the **virial theorem** yields

$$
pV = Nk_{B}T + \frac{1}{3}\left\langle \sum_{i<j} \mathbf r_{ij}\cdot \mathbf F_{ij} \right\rangle
$$

The ideal gas has $\mathbf F_{ij}=0$, so the second term vanishes.

---

### 9.3.5 Adiabats, sound speed, and quick thermodynamic moves

For a **reversible adiabatic** change ($dQ=0$) in a monatomic ideal gas,

$$
p V^{\gamma} = \text{const},\qquad T V^{\gamma-1} = \text{const},\qquad T^{\gamma} p^{1-\gamma} = \text{const}
$$

with $\gamma=5/3$. The **speed of sound** (small adiabatic density waves) is

$$
c_{s} = \sqrt{\gamma \frac{k_{B}T}{m}}
$$

For mixtures, replace $m$ by the mean molecular mass and $\gamma$ by the appropriate ratio of heat capacities.

---

### 9.3.6 External fields: barometric formula and separability

In a uniform gravitational field $U(z)=mgz$, the one-body Boltzmann weight factorizes:

$$
n(z) \propto e^{-\beta m g z},\qquad n(z) = n(0)\,e^{-z/H},\qquad H \equiv \frac{k_{B}T}{m g}
$$

The momentum and position parts separate, so kinetic-energy results (equipartition, MB speeds) survive untouched.

---

### 9.3.7 Transport in one screen: mean free path and friends

For hard spheres of diameter $d$ at number density $n$, the mean free path is

$$
\ell \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\,\pi d^{2}\,n}
$$

Using typical speed $\bar v \sim \langle v\rangle$,

$$
D \sim \frac{1}{3}\bar v\,\ell,\qquad
\eta \sim \frac{1}{3} n m \bar v\,\ell,\qquad
\kappa \sim \frac{1}{3} n C_{V}^{\text{per particle}} \bar v\,\ell
$$

These kinetic-theory scalings are remarkably good for dilute gases; real cross sections and mixtures refine the prefactors.

### 9.3.8 Validity of the classical picture

Classical, nondegenerate behavior requires the **diluteness** parameter to be small:

$$
n\,\lambda_{T}^{3} \ll 1
$$

If $n\lambda_{T}^{3}\gtrsim 1$ (low $T$ or high $n$), quantum statistics kicks in: bosons want Bose–Einstein, fermions go Pauli, and the MB distribution is no longer the move.

### 9.3.9 Beyond monatomic: what equipartition counts

For a rigid **linear diatomic** at intermediate $T$:

- $3$ translational + $2$ rotational quadratic modes → $f=5$ effective d.o.f., so $C_{V} \approx \tfrac{5}{2}Nk_{B}$, $\gamma \approx 7/5$
- Vibrations add $2$ more quadratic modes but only when $k_{B}T$ exceeds the vibrational quantum spacing; otherwise they’re frozen

Moral: **count only the modes that are active at your $T$**.

### 9.3.10 Worked mini-examples

**(a) RMS speed for air at room $T$**

For $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ with $m\approx 28\,\mathrm{u}$ at $T=300\ \mathrm{K}$,

$$
v_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}
$$

Plug numbers to get a few hundred $\mathrm{m/s}$; compare to $v_{\text{mp}}$ and $\langle v\rangle$.

**(b) Adiabatic compression**

A monatomic gas is compressed from $(p_{1},V_{1})$ to $(p_{2},V_{2})$ adiabatically. Use $pV^{\gamma}=\text{const}$ to find $T_{2}/T_{1}=(V_{1}/V_{2})^{\gamma-1}$.

**(c) Barometric scale height of helium**

For He at $T=300\ \mathrm{K}$, compute $H=k_{B}T/(m g)$ and compare to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ to see the mass dependence pop.

**(d) Mean free path at STP**

Take $d\approx 0.3\ \mathrm{nm}$, $n\approx 2.5\times 10^{25}\ \mathrm{m}^{-3}$; estimate $\ell$ and comment on why smells diffuse fast.

**(e) Equipartition sanity check**

Show directly from $\int dp\;p^{2} e^{-\beta p^{2}/2m}$ that $\langle p^{2}/2m\rangle = \tfrac{1}{2}k_{B}T$ and extend to three components.

---

### 9.3.11 Minimal problem kit

- Starting from $f(v)$, derive $v_{\text{mp}}$, $\langle v\rangle$, and $v_{\text{rms}}$  
- Prove the equipartition identity $\langle x\,\partial H/\partial x\rangle=k_{B}T$ for a quadratic coordinate and apply it to $p^{2}/2m$  
- Derive $p=\tfrac{2}{3}U/V$ via wall-collision counting and recover $pV=Nk_{B}T$  
- For a linear diatomic with rotational constant $B$, estimate the temperature where rotations “turn on” by comparing $k_{B}T$ to $\hbar^{2}/(2I)$  
- Check the classicality criterion for a cold atomic gas of density $n$ and temperature $T$: compute $n\lambda_{T}^{3}$ and discuss when quantum statistics is required

---

**In summary:** The ideal gas is a showcase: Gaussian components give Maxwell speeds; each quadratic mode chips in $\tfrac{1}{2}k_{B}T$; from that, $U$, $C_{V}$, $pV=Nk_{B}T$, adiabats, and sound speed fall out in two lines. When $n\lambda_{T}^{3}$ grows or level spacings matter, equipartition politely bows out and quantum statistics takes the mic


## 9.4 Fluctuations & the Fluctuation–Response Principle

Macroscopic laws look crisp because relative fluctuations scale like $1/\sqrt{N}$—until they don’t. This section organizes **what fluctuates**, **how much**, and **why responses equal fluctuations**. We connect the canonical, grand-canonical, and isothermal–isobaric ensembles; introduce static fluctuation–dissipation relations; link pair correlations to compressibility; and preview what breaks near critical points.

---

### 9.4.1 Energy and number: the two flagship variances

**Canonical (fixed $T,V,N$):**

$$
\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle = \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \beta^{2}}\ln Z = k_{B}T^{2}\,C_{V}
$$

Relative size shrinks as $\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle^{1/2}/U \sim 1/\sqrt{N}$ for normal systems.

**Grand canonical (fixed $T,V,\mu$):**

$$
\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial \mu}\right)_{T,V}
$$

Equivalently, in terms of density $n=N/V$ and isothermal compressibility $\kappa_{T} \equiv -\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T,N}$,

$$
\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = N\,k_{B}T\,n\,\kappa_{T}
$$

for a single-component fluid where $dn = \chi_{\mu}\,d\mu$ and standard thermodynamic identities have been used.

---

### 9.4.2 Volume fluctuations at fixed pressure

Holding $(T,p,N)$ fixed, the isothermal–isobaric partition function $\Delta$ generates

$$
\langle(\Delta V)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T,N} = k_{B}T\,V\,\kappa_{T}
$$

Again, **fluctuation = response**: compressibility measures how much $V$ wiggles when $p$ nudges; that same coefficient sets the equilibrium variance.

---

### 9.4.3 Static fluctuation–response in one line

Let a control $\lambda$ couple to an observable $X$ via $H \to H - \lambda X$ (so $X=-\partial H/\partial \lambda$). In the canonical ensemble,

$$
\chi_{XX} \equiv \left(\frac{\partial \langle X\rangle}{\partial \lambda}\right)_{T,V,N} = \beta\,\langle(\Delta X)^{2}\rangle
$$

Special cases:

- $X=E$, $\lambda$ shifts $\beta$: $\chi_{EE}$ reduces to $C_{V}/T$ and reproduces $\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle=k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}$  
- $X=N$ in the grand ensemble gives $\left(\partial N/\partial \mu\right)_{T,V}=\beta\,\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle$

Positivity of variances $\Rightarrow$ **stability**: $C_{V}\ge 0$, $\kappa_{T}\ge 0$ in ensembles with fixed $T$.

---

### 9.4.4 Correlations, structure factor, and the compressibility sum rule

Define the microscopic density $\hat n(\mathbf r)=\sum_{i}\delta(\mathbf r-\mathbf r_{i})$, the pair correlation $g(\mathbf r)$, and the **static structure factor**

$$
S(\mathbf k) \equiv \frac{1}{N}\left\langle \delta \hat n_{\mathbf k}\,\delta \hat n_{-\mathbf k}\right\rangle,\qquad \delta \hat n_{\mathbf k} \equiv \int d^{3}r\, e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf r}\,[\hat n(\mathbf r)-n]
$$

In a uniform fluid,

$$
S(\mathbf k) = 1 + n \int d^{3}r\, e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf r}\,[g(\mathbf r)-1]
$$

Taking $\mathbf k\to 0$ connects **microscopic correlations** to **macroscopic response**:

$$
S(0) = n\,k_{B}T\,\kappa_{T}
$$

This is the **compressibility sum rule**. Near a critical point, $\kappa_{T}\to \infty$ and $S(0)$ spikes—aka **critical opalescence**.

---

### 9.4.5 Saddle points, curvature, and large deviations

Microcanonical entropy $S(E)$ controls fluctuations through its **curvature**. Expand around the most probable energy $E^{\ast}$:

$$
S(E) \approx S(E^{\ast}) + \frac{1}{2}(E-E^{\ast})^{2}\left(\frac{\partial^{2} S}{\partial E^{2}}\right)_{E^{\ast}}
$$

Performing the Laplace transform to the canonical ensemble gives a Gaussian for $E$ with variance $( -k_{B}/S'' )$, equivalent to $k_{B}T^{2}C_{V}$. More generally, additive observables obey a **large-deviation principle**:

$$
\mathbb P\!\left(\frac{A}{N}\approx a\right)\sim e^{-N I(a)}
$$

where $I(a)\ge 0$ is the **rate function** (Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function). At first-order transitions the relevant thermodynamic potential develops multiple competing saddles → **non-Gaussian** fluctuations and phase coexistence.

---

### 9.4.6 Critical fluctuations and correlation length

Let $\phi$ be an order parameter (e.g., magnetization density). Define the connected correlator

$$
G(\mathbf r) \equiv \langle \phi(\mathbf r)\phi(\mathbf 0)\rangle_{c}
$$

Away from criticality,

$$
G(\mathbf r) \sim \frac{e^{-r/\xi}}{r^{d-2+\eta}}
$$

with finite correlation length $\xi$. The static susceptibility $\chi \equiv \int d^{d}r\, G(\mathbf r)$ scales as

$$
\chi \sim \xi^{2-\eta}
$$

Therefore, in a volume $V$, the variance of the spatially averaged order parameter scales like $\mathrm{Var}(\bar\phi) \sim \chi/V$. When $\xi$ is finite, relative fluctuations $\sim 1/\sqrt{V}$. As $T\to T_{c}$, $\xi\to\infty$ and the $1/\sqrt{N}$ law **breaks down**.

---

### 9.4.7 Finite-size scaling: when N is large but not infinite

- For **noncritical** systems: $\mathrm{Var}(A) \propto N$ for additive $A$ → relative size $\propto N^{-1/2}$.  
- Near criticality: with $\xi$ comparable to system size $L$, replace $\xi$ by $L$ in scaling formulas; peaks in specific heat or susceptibility **round** and **shift** with $L$ in predictable ways (used to extract critical exponents numerically).

---

### 9.4.8 Example: noninteracting paramagnet and Curie law

$N$ spins $s=\tfrac12$ in field $B$ with Hamiltonian $H=-\mu B\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}$, $\sigma_{i}=\pm 1$. The single-spin partition function is $z=2\cosh(\beta\mu B)$, magnetization per spin

$$
m \equiv \frac{\langle M\rangle}{N} = \mu\,\tanh(\beta\mu B)
$$

Variance of $M$ is binomial:

$$
\langle(\Delta M)^{2}\rangle = N\,\mu^{2}\,\mathrm{sech}^{2}(\beta\mu B)
$$

Static susceptibility $\chi \equiv \left(\partial \langle M\rangle/\partial B\right)_{T}$ matches fluctuation–response:

$$
\chi = \beta\,\langle(\Delta M)^{2}\rangle = \frac{N\mu^{2}}{k_{B}T}\,\mathrm{sech}^{2}(\beta\mu B)
$$

In the weak-field limit, Curie law:

$$
\chi \approx \frac{N\mu^{2}}{k_{B}T}
$$

---

### 9.4.9 Example: ideal gas density fluctuations and S(0)

In a classical ideal gas, particles are uncorrelated: $g(\mathbf r)=1$. Then $S(\mathbf k)=1$ for all $\mathbf k$ and

$$
S(0) = 1 = n\,k_{B}T\,\kappa_{T}
$$

so $\kappa_{T}=1/(n k_{B}T)$, the ideal-gas result. Number variance in a subvolume $V'$ is **Poissonian**: $\langle(\Delta N')^{2}\rangle=\langle N'\rangle$.

---

### 9.4.10 Common pitfalls

- **Mixing ensembles.** Don’t use canonical $C_{V}$ with grand-canonical number fluctuations unless you’ve matched the ensemble to the measurement.  
- **Forcing Gaussian fits near transitions.** At first order, distributions are bimodal (two phases); at criticality, power-law tails win.  
- **Ignoring constraints.** Conserved totals suppress variances (e.g., fixed total $N$ reduces subvolume fluctuations).  
- **Calling negative $C_{V}$ “instability.”** In microcanonical small systems with long-range forces, $C_{V}<0$ can appear; it signals ensemble inequivalence, not algebra failure.

---

### 9.4.11 Worked mini-examples

**(a) $N\!pT$ volume variance**  
From $\Delta=\int dV\,e^{-\beta pV}Z$, show $\langle(\Delta V)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\,V\,\kappa_{T}$ and verify it for an ideal gas.

**(b) Compressibility sum rule**  
Starting with $S(\mathbf k)=1+n\int d^{3}r\,e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r}[g(r)-1]$, take $\mathbf k\to 0$ and use thermodynamics to derive $S(0)=n k_{B}T\kappa_{T}$.

**(c) Energy large deviations**  
From $Z=\int dE\,e^{S(E)/k_{B}-\beta E}$, do the quadratic expansion and read off $\langle(\Delta E)^{2}\rangle$; identify when the Gaussian approximation fails.

**(d) Paramagnet variance → Curie**  
Compute $\langle M\rangle$ and $\langle M^{2}\rangle$ from $z$ and show $\chi=\beta\langle(\Delta M)^{2}\rangle$; take $B\to 0$ to get $\chi\propto 1/T$.

**(e) Subvolume fluctuations**  
For an ideal gas, partition a box into two volumes $V'$ and $V-V'$. With fixed total $N$, show $\mathrm{Var}(N')=N(V'/V)(1-V'/V)$ (binomial), contrasting with grand-canonical Poisson variance.

---

### 9.4.12 Minimal problem kit

- Prove the general static relation $\chi_{XX}=\beta\langle(\Delta X)^{2}\rangle$ from derivatives of $\ln Z$ with a source term  
- Derive $\langle(\Delta N)^{2}\rangle = k_{B}T\left(\partial N/\partial\mu\right)_{T,V}$ and connect it to $\kappa_{T}$ for a single-component fluid  
- Show that $S(0)=n k_{B}T\kappa_{T}$ implies $S(0)\to\infty$ as a liquid approaches its gas–liquid critical point and explain “critical opalescence” qualitatively  
- Using a Landau $\phi^{4}$ free energy $f=a(T-T_{c})\phi^{2}+b\phi^{4}$, compute Gaussian fluctuations above $T_{c}$ and extract $\chi\propto 1/(T-T_{c})$ at mean-field level  
- For a lattice model with conserved order parameter, discuss how conservation modifies long-time relaxation (but not equal-time static variances) at fixed $T$

---

**In summary:** Equilibrium fluctuations aren’t noise—they’re **thermometers**. Variances of $E$, $N$, $V$, $M$ equal the corresponding response coefficients times $k_{B}T$; pair correlations feed macroscopic compressibility; and curvature of thermodynamic potentials sets Gaussian widths until phase transitions wreck the approximation. Away from criticality, $1/\sqrt{N}$ keeps the macroscopic world calm; near a critical point, correlation length and susceptibilities blow up and fluctuations take center stage
