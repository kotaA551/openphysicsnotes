Gauge Theory
---

We work in natural units ($\hbar=c=1$). **Gauge theory** is physics built from a local symmetry.  
Start with a global phase symmetry $\psi \!\to\! e^{i\alpha}\psi$; promoting $\alpha\!\to\!\alpha(x)$ forces us to introduce a gauge field so that derivatives transform covariantly.

## 6.1  From global to local

A free Dirac field has
$$
\mathcal L_0=\bar\psi(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m)\psi .
$$
Under $\psi\!\to\!e^{i\alpha(x)}\psi$, $\partial_\mu\psi$ picks up an extra piece.  
Introduce a gauge field $A_\mu$ and the **covariant derivative**
$$
D_\mu\equiv \partial_\mu+ieA_\mu ,\qquad \psi\to e^{i\alpha(x)}\psi,\quad
A_\mu\to A_\mu-\frac{1}{e}\,\partial_\mu\alpha .
$$

## 6.2  Abelian gauge theory (QED)

Define field strength
$$
F_{\mu\nu}\equiv \partial_\mu A_\nu-\partial_\nu A_\mu ,
$$
which is gauge invariant. The QED Lagrangian is
$$
\mathcal L_{\text{QED}}=-\frac14 F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
+\bar\psi(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi .
$$
Euler–Lagrange gives Maxwell’s equations with current $j^\mu=\bar\psi\gamma^\mu\psi$.
Gauge fixing (e.g. Lorenz $\partial_\mu A^\mu=0$) is needed for quantization.

## 6.3  Non-Abelian (Yang–Mills)

For a compact Lie group $G$ with generators $T^a$,
$$
D_\mu=\partial_\mu-igA_\mu^a T^a,\qquad
F_{\mu\nu}^a=\partial_\mu A_\nu^a-\partial_\nu A_\mu^a+g f^{abc}A_\mu^bA_\nu^c .
$$
Under $U(x)=e^{i\alpha^a(x)T^a}$,
$$
A_\mu\to U A_\mu U^{-1}+\tfrac{i}{g}(\partial_\mu U)U^{-1},\qquad
F_{\mu\nu}\to U F_{\mu\nu} U^{-1}.
$$
The Yang–Mills Lagrangian with matter $\psi$ in representation $R$:
$$
\mathcal L_{\text{YM}}=-\frac14 F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a\,\mu\nu}
+\bar\psi\big(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m\big)\psi .
$$

## 6.4  Noether currents

Global transformations give a conserved current.  
For QED: $j^\mu=\bar\psi\gamma^\mu\psi$, $\partial_\mu j^\mu=0$.  
For non-Abelian: $J^{a\,\mu}=\bar\psi\gamma^\mu T^a\psi + f^{abc}F^{b\,\mu\nu}A_\nu^c$.

## 6.5  Spontaneous symmetry breaking & Higgs

A complex scalar $\phi$ with potential $V=\lambda(|\phi|^2-\tfrac{v^2}{2})^2$ and $D_\mu=\partial_\mu+ieA_\mu$:
$$
\mathcal L=-(1/4)F^2+|D_\mu\phi|^2-V(|\phi|^2).
$$
Expanding around $\langle\phi\rangle=v/\sqrt2$ gives a **mass** $m_A=ev$ for $A_\mu$ and a physical Higgs scalar; the would-be Goldstone is eaten (Higgs mechanism).

## 6.6  Renormalization & running

For a simple gauge group,
$$
\mu\frac{dg}{d\mu}=\beta(g)=-\frac{b_0}{16\pi^2}g^3+\cdots,
\qquad
b_0=\tfrac{11}{3}C_A-\tfrac{4}{3}T_R n_f-\tfrac{1}{6}T_R n_s .
$$
$C_A$ is the adjoint Casimir, $T_R$ the trace normalization.  
$SU(3)$ with light quarks has $b_0>0$ → **asymptotic freedom**; $U(1)$ has the opposite sign at one loop.

## 6.7  Topology in gauge theory (quick peek)

Instantons in 4D Euclidean YM carry integer charge
$$
Q=\frac{1}{32\pi^2}\int d^4x\, \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
\,\text{tr}\!\left(F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}\right)\in\mathbb Z,
$$
leading to a $\theta$ term $\mathcal L_\theta=\frac{\theta}{32\pi^2}\text{tr}(F\tilde F)$.

**Bottom line:** Gauge fields arise because we insist on *local* symmetry. QED is Abelian; Yang–Mills is the non-Abelian upgrade with self-interactions, running couplings, and symmetry breaking via the Higgs mechanism.
