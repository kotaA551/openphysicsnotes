# 11.1 Modern Astronomy’s Development

The age of modern astronomy began in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when the telescope became not only an instrument of navigation but also a tool for mapping the cosmos. From William Herschel’s star surveys to the spectral analysis of starlight, this period transformed astronomy from positional cataloguing into astrophysics — the physics of celestial bodies.

## William Herschel and the Mapping of the Milky Way

William Herschel (1738–1822) was originally a musician from Hanover who emigrated to England. Fascinated by optics, he constructed his own reflecting telescopes, some of the largest of his time. On March 13, 1781, he discovered **Uranus**, the first planet to be found in recorded history beyond the five visible to the naked eye. This discovery expanded the boundaries of the Solar System and demonstrated that the sky still held secrets awaiting discovery.

Herschel’s ambition, however, went beyond planets. With his sister Caroline Herschel — herself the discoverer of multiple comets — he undertook systematic surveys of the night sky. Night after night, they counted and catalogued thousands of stars and nebulae. From these counts, William attempted to draw a crude “map” of the Milky Way, hypothesizing that our Solar System lay within a disk of stars.

Though limited by the extinction of starlight through interstellar dust (unknown at the time), Herschel’s work marked the beginning of **statistical astronomy**: the idea that large-scale surveys could reveal the structure of the universe.

## The Rise of Spectral Analysis

Until the mid-nineteenth century, the stars were essentially mysterious lights: their distances were immeasurable, their compositions unknowable. This changed dramatically with the discovery of spectroscopy.

Joseph von Fraunhofer had observed in 1814 that the Sun’s spectrum contained hundreds of dark absorption lines. Later, in the 1850s, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen identified these lines with specific chemical elements. Each element leaves a characteristic “fingerprint” in light, allowing scientists to determine the chemical composition of distant objects without ever touching them.

> This was revolutionary: for the first time, humanity could read the “DNA of the stars.”

From this point forward, astronomy merged with physics and chemistry, becoming **astrophysics**. The Sun and stars were revealed to contain hydrogen, helium, and heavier elements, overturning the ancient belief that heavenly bodies were made of some perfect, incorruptible “aether.”

## The Energy Problem of Stars

By the late nineteenth century, a profound mystery arose: *what powers the Sun and stars?*

The gravitational contraction model, proposed by Hermann von Helmholtz and Lord Kelvin, suggested that the Sun shines because it is slowly contracting under its own gravity. The potential energy released would indeed produce heat, but calculations showed this would only allow the Sun to shine for about **20 million years**. Yet geological and biological evidence already suggested that Earth, and life upon it, was far older — hundreds of millions, even billions of years.

This paradox foreshadowed the inadequacy of classical physics to explain stellar energy.

## The Quantum and Relativistic Revolution

The solution came only in the twentieth century, through the convergence of nuclear physics and Einstein’s relativity. The mass–energy equivalence,

$$
E = mc^{2},
$$

demonstrated that tiny amounts of mass could be converted into enormous amounts of energy. Nuclear fusion — the fusion of hydrogen into helium in stellar cores — was eventually recognized as the process that powers the stars. But before that breakthrough, the **energy problem** haunted astrophysics for decades, driving the search for new physics.

## Reflection

The nineteenth century thus transformed astronomy. It ceased to be merely “the geometry of the heavens” and became a physical science concerned with the life, composition, and dynamics of stars. The mysteries remaining — the nature of galaxies, the structure of the universe, the fate of stars — would dominate the next century of research.

This was the dawn of astrophysics.

# 11.2 General Relativity and the First Cosmological Models

The dawn of the twentieth century brought an upheaval in both physics and astronomy. Newtonian gravity had explained the motions of planets and comets for over two centuries, but it began to show cracks. The most famous was the anomalous precession of Mercury’s orbit, which stubbornly resisted explanation. A new theory of gravity was needed — and Albert Einstein provided it in 1915 with the **General Theory of Relativity**.

## Einstein’s Curved Spacetime

Einstein’s key insight was that gravity is not a force in the Newtonian sense, but a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime itself. Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move.

The fundamental equation of general relativity is the **Einstein field equation**:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\mu\nu},
$$

where

- $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor, describing spacetime curvature,  
- $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant,  
- $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress–energy tensor, describing matter and energy.

This equation allowed for solutions describing entire universes, not just planets or stars.

## The Cosmological Constant and Einstein’s “Greatest Blunder”

When Einstein first applied his theory to the universe as a whole in 1917, he assumed that the cosmos must be **static and eternal**. However, his equations naturally predicted either expansion or contraction. To enforce stability, he introduced an extra term, the **cosmological constant** $\Lambda$, which counteracted gravity on cosmic scales.

Later discoveries would reveal that the universe is expanding. Einstein reportedly called his introduction of $\Lambda$ his *“greatest blunder.”* Yet in modern cosmology, the cosmological constant has returned — reinterpreted as **dark energy**, the driver of cosmic acceleration.

## Alexander Friedmann and Dynamic Universes

In 1922, the Russian mathematician **Alexander Friedmann** derived solutions to Einstein’s equations without assuming a static universe. He showed that if the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, then its scale factor $a(t)$ evolves in time according to what we now call the **Friedmann equations**:

$$
\left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^{2} = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{k}{a^{2}} + \frac{\Lambda}{3},
$$

$$
\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} \left( \rho + \frac{3p}{c^{2}} \right) + \frac{\Lambda}{3},
$$

where $\rho$ is the matter density, $p$ is pressure, and $k$ describes spatial curvature.

Friedmann’s work implied that the universe could be expanding or contracting — a radical departure from the static model.

## Georges Lemaître and the “Primeval Atom”

Independently, in 1927, the Belgian priest and physicist **Georges Lemaître** proposed that the universe is expanding. He even suggested that it originated from a “primeval atom” — an explosive beginning that presaged the Big Bang theory. At first, his ideas were met with skepticism, especially from Einstein, who told him: *“Your calculations are correct, but your physics is abominable.”*

Ironically, history would vindicate Lemaître, as observations soon confirmed his vision.

## The 1919 Eclipse and Eddington’s Expedition

General relativity would have remained a mathematical curiosity had it not been for a daring experiment. During the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, British astronomer **Arthur Eddington** led expeditions to Principe (off the coast of Africa) and Sobral (Brazil) to measure the deflection of starlight by the Sun’s gravity.

Einstein had predicted a deflection of **1.75 arcseconds**, twice the Newtonian expectation. Eddington’s measurements agreed with Einstein’s theory, and the results made front-page news around the world. Einstein became an international celebrity overnight, and general relativity gained empirical legitimacy.

## Reflection

By the 1930s, the stage was set for a profound reimagining of the cosmos. The universe was no longer a static backdrop; it was a dynamic entity, potentially with a beginning. The tools of general relativity provided a new language to describe it. Soon, observational astronomers — most famously Edwin Hubble — would supply the decisive evidence.

This was the birth of **cosmology** as a modern scientific discipline.
