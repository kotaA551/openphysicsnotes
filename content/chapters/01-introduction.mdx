<Callout type="info">
**Mission:** make the path to quantum gravity feel **learnable**, not mystical. We’ll layer ideas: classical → relativity → quantum → fields → gravity → (hints of) quantum gravity.

### Why physics (in one paragraph)
Physics is the art of writing short stories about reality, where the plot is logic, the characters are symmetries, and the punchlines are equations.


### The staircase
1. **Classical mechanics** (Newton, Hamilton, Lagrange) — how to summarize motion in a single function: the action.
2. **Relativity** (special → general) — spacetime geometry, not forces, tells matter how to move.
3. **Quantum mechanics** — amplitudes, not certainties.
4. **Quantum fields** — particles are ripples in fields.
5. **Gravity** — geometry itself becomes dynamical.
6. **Quantum gravity** — make geometry play by quantum rules.


We’ll keep proofs honest but focus on **intuition** and **calculation patterns**.
