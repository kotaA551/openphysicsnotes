## 10.1 Crystals & Reciprocal Space

Crystalline solids are periodic in space. Periodicity gives you enormous leverage: lattices turn sums into selection rules, Fourier transforms quantize $k$, and diffraction fingerprints structure. This section lays down the lattice–basis language, reciprocal vectors, Brillouin zones, Miller indices, and the diffraction toolkit (Bragg, Laue, Ewald, structure factors). We’ll tie together fcc/bcc duality, selection rules for common crystals, and quick ways to not get lost in indices.

### 10.1.1 Lattice, basis, crystal structure

A **Bravais lattice** is the set of points

$$
\mathbf R = n_{1}\,\mathbf a_{1} + n_{2}\,\mathbf a_{2} + n_{3}\,\mathbf a_{3},\qquad n_{i}\in\mathbb Z
$$

with three linearly independent **primitive vectors** $\mathbf a_{i}$. A **crystal structure** = lattice **plus** a basis of atoms at positions $\{\boldsymbol\tau_{j}\}$ inside a primitive cell; the atomic positions are $\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \boldsymbol\tau_{j}$.

- **Wigner–Seitz cell**: the set of points closer to a given lattice point than any other.  
- **Conventional vs primitive**: conventional cubic cells are nicer to look at; primitive cells are minimal-volume and great for theory.

**Pro tip**: never say “the diamond lattice.” Diamond has an **fcc lattice** with a two-point basis $\{(0,0,0),\,(\tfrac12,\tfrac12,\tfrac12)a\}$.

---

### 10.1.2 Symmetry: point groups and space groups (one-screenshot tour)

- **Point group**: rotations, reflections, inversion that leave at least one point fixed.  
- **Space group**: point-group ops + **translations** + **screw** rotations and **glide** reflections.  
- In 3D there are **14 Bravais lattices**, **32** crystallographic point groups, and **230** space groups. For band theory you mostly need the lattice and the little groups of high-symmetry $k$ points.

---

### 10.1.3 Reciprocal lattice and Brillouin zone

Define the **reciprocal primitive vectors** $\mathbf b_{i}$ by $\mathbf a_{i}\cdot \mathbf b_{j}=2\pi\delta_{ij}$. In vector form

$$
\mathbf b_{1} = 2\pi \frac{\mathbf a_{2}\times \mathbf a_{3}}{\mathbf a_{1}\cdot (\mathbf a_{2}\times \mathbf a_{3})},\quad
\mathbf b_{2} = 2\pi \frac{\mathbf a_{3}\times \mathbf a_{1}}{\mathbf a_{1}\cdot (\mathbf a_{2}\times \mathbf a_{3})},\quad
\mathbf b_{3} = 2\pi \frac{\mathbf a_{1}\times \mathbf a_{2}}{\mathbf a_{1}\cdot (\mathbf a_{2}\times \mathbf a_{3})}
$$

The **reciprocal lattice** consists of vectors $\mathbf G = h\,\mathbf b_{1} + k\,\mathbf b_{2} + \ell\,\mathbf b_{3}$ with integers $(h,k,\ell)$.

The **first Brillouin zone (BZ)** is the Wigner–Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice. It is the primitive cell in $k$-space and the natural domain for Bloch wavevectors.

- Duality: **fcc $\leftrightarrow$ bcc**. The reciprocal of fcc is bcc and vice versa. Simple cubic is self-dual.

---

### 10.1.4 Bloch theorem in one line

In a periodic potential $V(\mathbf r+\mathbf R)=V(\mathbf r)$, single-particle eigenstates are **Bloch waves**:

$$
\psi_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r) = e^{i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf r}\,u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r),\qquad u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r+\mathbf R) = u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r)
$$

Wavevectors $\mathbf k$ can be chosen in the first BZ. Translating $\mathbf k\to \mathbf k+\mathbf G$ leaves physics invariant.

---

### 10.1.5 Planes, directions, and indices (Miller crash course)

- **Directions** use square brackets $[u\,v\,w]$ for a lattice vector proportional to $u\,\mathbf a_{1}+v\,\mathbf a_{2}+w\,\mathbf a_{3}$. Families of equivalent directions: $\langle u\,v\,w\rangle$.  
- **Planes** use parentheses $(h\,k\,\ell)$, the **Miller indices**, defined as reciprocals of intercepts along $\mathbf a_{i}$. Families: $\{h\,k\,\ell\}$.  
- **Spacing** to plane family $(h\,k\,\ell)$ is tied to the reciprocal vector $\mathbf G_{hkl}$:

$$
\mathbf G_{hkl} = h\,\mathbf b_{1} + k\,\mathbf b_{2} + \ell\,\mathbf b_{3}
$$

$$
d_{hkl} = \frac{2\pi}{|\mathbf G_{hkl}|}
$$

For **cubic** $a_{1}=a\,\hat x$ etc., $d_{hkl}= a/\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+\ell^{2}}$.

**Hexagonal** often uses Miller–Bravais $(h\,k\,i\,\ell)$ with $i=-(h+k)$ to make basal-plane symmetry manifest.

---

### 10.1.6 Diffraction: Bragg, Laue, Ewald are the same vibe

Elastic scattering conserves $|\mathbf k|=|\mathbf k'|$ and transfers crystal momentum $\Delta\mathbf k=\mathbf k'-\mathbf k$ equal to a reciprocal vector:

$$
\Delta \mathbf k = \mathbf G
$$

**Bragg condition** in real space:

$$
2 d_{hkl}\,\sin\theta = n\,\lambda
$$

**Laue condition** in $k$-space is exactly $\mathbf k'-\mathbf k=\mathbf G$. **Ewald sphere** construction: draw a sphere of radius $|\mathbf k|=2\pi/\lambda$ anchored at the tail of $\mathbf k$; reciprocal-lattice points on the sphere give allowed reflections.

**Structure factor** encodes the basis:

$$
F(\mathbf G) = \sum_{j=1}^{m} f_{j}\,e^{-i\mathbf G\cdot \boldsymbol\tau_{j}}
$$

with atomic form factors $f_{j}$. The diffracted intensity is

$$
I(\mathbf G) \propto |F(\mathbf G)|^{2}
$$

The lattice sum enforces $\mathbf G$ belongs to the reciprocal lattice; $F$ decides if it actually lights up.

---

### 10.1.7 Selection rules for common structures

- **Simple cubic (sc)** with one atom at $(0,0,0)$:

$$
F(\mathbf G)=f,\quad \text{no systematic absences}
$$

- **Body-centered cubic (bcc)**, basis $\{(0,0,0),\,(\tfrac12,\tfrac12,\tfrac12)a\}$:

$$
F = f\left[1 + e^{-i\pi(h+k+\ell)}\right] = 
\begin{cases}
2f & h+k+\ell\ \text{even} \\
0 & h+k+\ell\ \text{odd}
\end{cases}
$$

- **Face-centered cubic (fcc)**, basis $\{(0,0,0),\,(\tfrac12,\tfrac12,0)a,\,(\tfrac12,0,\tfrac12)a,\,(0,\tfrac12,\tfrac12)a\}$:

$$
F = f\left[1 + e^{-i\pi(h+k)} + e^{-i\pi(h+\ell)} + e^{-i\pi(k+\ell)}\right] =
\begin{cases}
4f & h,k,\ell\ \text{all even or all odd} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

- **NaCl (rock salt)**: fcc lattice with two-species basis $\{(0,0,0)\ \text{Na},\ (\tfrac12,\tfrac12,\tfrac12)a\ \text{Cl}\}$. Then

$$
F = f_{\mathrm{Na}} + f_{\mathrm{Cl}}\,e^{-i\pi(h+k+\ell)}
$$

Intensity alternates with $h+k+\ell$ depending on $f$-contrast.

- **Diamond**: fcc lattice with basis $\{(0,0,0),\,(\tfrac14,\tfrac14,\tfrac14)a\}$. Extra phase leads to additional systematic zeros beyond fcc.

---

### 10.1.8 fcc–bcc duality and high-symmetry $k$ points

If $\{\mathbf a_{i}\}$ are **fcc** vectors, the reciprocal $\{\mathbf b_{i}\}$ generate a **bcc** lattice in $k$-space (and vice versa). Learn the standard labels:

- **fcc BZ**: $\Gamma$ center, $X$ at face centers, $L$ at BZ corners, $W$ mid-edges.  
- **bcc BZ**: $\Gamma$, $H$, $N$, $P$ points.  

These are where band extrema and degeneracies love to appear and where experimentalists measure ARPES and quantum oscillations.

---

### 10.1.9 Real ↔ reciprocal geometry cheats

- **Volume relation**:

$$
V_{\mathrm{cell}}\,V_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\ast} = (2\pi)^{3}
$$

- **Plane normal**: the reciprocal vector $\mathbf G_{hkl}$ is **normal** to the $(hkl)$ planes.  
- **Angle between planes** $(h_{1}k_{1}\ell_{1})$ and $(h_{2}k_{2}\ell_{2})$:

$$
\cos\theta = \frac{\mathbf G_{1}\cdot \mathbf G_{2}}{|\mathbf G_{1}|\,|\mathbf G_{2}|}
$$

- **Spacing** again: $d_{hkl}=2\pi/|\mathbf G_{hkl}|$.

---

### 10.1.10 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Reciprocal of bcc is fcc**  
Start with bcc conventional cubic cell of side $a$ and primitive vectors $\mathbf a_{1}=\tfrac a2(\hat y+\hat z-\hat x)$ etc. Compute $\mathbf b_{i}$ and show the reciprocal points sit at face centers of a cubic net with spacing $2\pi/a$.

**(b) $d_{hkl}$ for cubic**  
Using $\mathbf G_{hkl}=(2\pi/a)(h\,\hat x + k\,\hat y + \ell\,\hat z)$, show $d_{hkl}=a/\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+\ell^{2}}$. Bragg gives $2d\sin\theta=n\lambda$; solve for the $(111)$ first-order reflection angle for given $\lambda/a$.

**(c) fcc systematic absences**  
Evaluate $F$ for $(100)$, $(110)$, $(111)$ families and confirm only “all even” or “all odd” survive.

**(d) Diamond zeros**  
Diamond has $F \propto \left[1 + e^{-i\pi(h+k+\ell)/2}\right]\times(\text{fcc factor})$. Show that $(222)$ is extinct but $(111)$ is allowed, consistent with X-ray tables.

**(e) Ewald construction sketch**  
For $\lambda=1.54\ \text{\AA}$ (Cu K$\alpha$), draw a circle of radius $2\pi/\lambda$ through the origin of the reciprocal fcc lattice and mark which $\mathbf G$ vectors on the circle predict reflections for a given crystal orientation.

---

### 10.1.11 Common pitfalls

- **Confusing lattice with structure**: lattice is the periodic scaffold; the **basis** puts atoms on it.  
- **Wrong units in reciprocal space**: crystallographers often use $2\pi$-free convention; here $a_{i}\cdot b_{j}=2\pi\delta_{ij}$. Pick one and stay loyal.  
- **Miller vs direction indices**: $(hkl)$ is a plane, $[uvw]$ is a direction. For cubic, $(hkl)\perp [hkl]$; not true in general.  
- **Forgetting the form factor**: even if $F\neq 0$, $f_{j}(\mathbf G)$ decays with $|\mathbf G|$, reshaping intensities.  
- **BZ confusion**: the “reduced zone” scheme folds $k$ into the first BZ; if bands look doubled, you probably mixed extended vs reduced plots.

---

### 10.1.12 Minimal problem kit

- Derive the reciprocal vectors $\mathbf b_{i}$ from $\mathbf a_{i}$ and prove $V_{\mathrm{cell}}\,V_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\ast}=(2\pi)^{3}$  
- Show that the Laue condition $\mathbf k'-\mathbf k=\mathbf G$ and Bragg’s law $2d\sin\theta=n\lambda$ are equivalent via $\mathbf G$ geometry  
- Compute the structure factor and selection rules for NaCl and CsCl; compare which $(hkl)$ vanish in each  
- For a hexagonal lattice with $a$ and $c$, write $\mathbf b_{i}$ and obtain $d_{hkl}$ in terms of $(h\,k\,i\,\ell)$  
- Locate the high-symmetry points $\Gamma$, $X$, $L$, $W$ for fcc in Cartesian $k$-coordinates given $a$, and sketch the first BZ

---

**In summary:** Lattice periodicity turns real-space order into reciprocal-space selection. The reciprocal lattice and the first Brillouin zone are not optional—they’re the natural stage for electrons, phonons, and diffraction. Master $\mathbf a$/$\mathbf b$, $(hkl)$/$[uvw]$, and $F(\mathbf G)$ once, and you’ll read both band structures and diffraction patterns like a native

## 10.2 Lattice Vibrations & Phonons

Atoms in a crystal aren’t statues; they wiggle. Those collective wiggles are **phonons**: quantized normal modes of the lattice. In this section we go from 1D chains to full 3D dynamical matrices, split **acoustic** vs **optical** branches, compute dispersions, group velocities, and densities of states, then quantize. We also hit thermal transport, anharmonicity, thermal expansion via the Grüneisen parameter, electron–phonon coupling, and quick experimental fingerprints (neutron, Raman, IR).

---

### 10.2.1 Harmonic lattice: setting the stage

Let $\mathbf R$ label Bravais sites and $\kappa$ the basis atom index inside a unit cell. The displacement of atom $(\mathbf R,\kappa)$ is $\mathbf u_{\kappa}(\mathbf R,t)$. In the **harmonic** approximation the potential energy is quadratic in displacements:

$$
U = \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{\mathbf R\kappa\alpha}\sum_{\mathbf R'\kappa'\beta}
\Phi_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R-\mathbf R')\,u_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf R)\,u_{\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R')
$$

where $\Phi$ are **force constants** and $\alpha,\beta\in\{x,y,z\}$. Newton:

$$
M_{\kappa}\,\ddot u_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf R,t) = -\sum_{\mathbf R'\kappa'\beta} \Phi_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R-\mathbf R')\,u_{\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R',t)
$$

Try plane-wave solutions $u_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf R,t)=e_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf q)\,e^{i(\mathbf q\cdot \mathbf R - \omega t)}$. You get an eigenproblem

$$
\sum_{\kappa'\beta} D_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf q)\,e_{\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf q) = \omega^{2}(\mathbf q)\,e_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf q)
$$

with the **dynamical matrix**

$$
D_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{\kappa}M_{\kappa'}}}
\sum_{\mathbf R} \Phi_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R)\,e^{i\mathbf q\cdot \mathbf R}
$$

For $r$ atoms per cell you get $3r$ branches: 3 acoustic $\omega\to 0$ as $\mathbf q\to 0$, and $3r-3$ optical.

---

### 10.2.2 1D monatomic chain: the cleanest demo

Masses $m$ connected by springs $K$ with lattice spacing $a$. Let $u_{n}$ be the displacement of site $n$. Equation of motion:

$$
m\,\ddot u_{n} = K\,(u_{n+1} - 2u_{n} + u_{n-1})
$$

Ansatz $u_{n}=u_{0}e^{i(nka-\omega t)}$ gives the dispersion

$$
\omega(k) = 2\sqrt{\frac{K}{m}}\;\left|\sin\frac{ka}{2}\right|
$$

Key takeaways:

- **Acoustic** branch only, linear near $k=0$ with sound speed $v_{s}=a\sqrt{K/m}$  
- **Brillouin zone** is $-\pi/a<k\le \pi/a$; $\omega(k)$ is periodic with $2\pi/a$  
- **Group velocity** $v_{g}(k)=\partial\omega/\partial k$ controls energy flow

**Density of states** in 1D for a single branch:

$$
g(\omega) = \frac{L}{\pi}\,\frac{1}{|d\omega/dk|}
$$

So $g(\omega)$ diverges at BZ edges where $d\omega/dk\to 0$ (van Hove singularity).

---

### 10.2.3 1D diatomic chain: acoustic + optical

Two alternating masses $m_{1},m_{2}$, same spring $K$, unit cell length $a$ containing both atoms. With nearest-neighbor coupling, the two-branch dispersion is

$$
\omega^{2}(k) = K\left(\frac{1}{m_{1}}+\frac{1}{m_{2}}\right)
\pm \sqrt{K^{2}\left(\frac{1}{m_{1}}+\frac{1}{m_{2}}\right)^{2} - \frac{4K^{2}}{m_{1}m_{2}}\sin^{2}\!\frac{ka}{2}}
$$

- The **minus** sign is the **acoustic** branch with $\omega\to 0$ as $k\to 0$  
- The **plus** sign is the **optical** branch with $\omega(k=0)=\sqrt{2K(1/m_{1}+1/m_{2})}$

At $k=0$ the acoustic mode moves the two atoms **in phase**; the optical mode moves them **out of phase**. A **gap** opens at the zone boundary.

---

### 10.2.4 3D crystals: polarizations and sound speeds

For $r=1$ (monatomic Bravais) you have 3 acoustic branches: one **longitudinal** (LA) and two **transverse** (TA). Near $\mathbf q=0$ they are **sound waves** with linear dispersion

$$
\omega_{\text{LA}}(\mathbf q) \approx v_{L}|\mathbf q|,\qquad \omega_{\text{TA}}(\mathbf q) \approx v_{T}|\mathbf q|
$$

In cubic crystals the speeds relate to elastic constants and mass density $\rho$ (continuum limit):

$$
v_{L} = \sqrt{\frac{C_{11}}{\rho}},\qquad v_{T} = \sqrt{\frac{C_{44}}{\rho}}
$$

More generally, the Christoffel equation gives direction-dependent velocities.

For $r>1$ you add $3r-3$ **optical** branches that typically have weak $\mathbf q$-dispersion near the zone center. If the basis carries opposite charges, some optical modes are **IR active** (see §10.14).

---

### 10.2.5 Quantization: phonons as bosons

Promote each normal mode $(\mathbf q,s)$ to a harmonic oscillator:

$$
H = \sum_{\mathbf q,s} \hbar\omega_{\mathbf q s}\left(b^{\dagger}_{\mathbf q s} b_{\mathbf q s} + \tfrac{1}{2}\right)
$$

with $[b_{\mathbf q s},b^{\dagger}_{\mathbf q' s'}]=\delta_{\mathbf q\mathbf q'}\delta_{ss'}$. The displacement operator is

$$
\mathbf u_{\kappa}(\mathbf R) = \sum_{\mathbf q,s} \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M_{\kappa} N \omega_{\mathbf q s}}}\;
\mathbf e_{\kappa s}(\mathbf q)\,\left(b_{\mathbf q s} e^{i\mathbf q\cdot \mathbf R} + b^{\dagger}_{\mathbf q s} e^{-i\mathbf q\cdot \mathbf R}\right)
$$

Phonon occupation follows Bose statistics with chemical potential $\mu=0$ in equilibrium.

---

### 10.2.6 Heat capacity and Debye revisit

Total phonon energy per volume $U/V=\sum_{s}\int d\omega\,\hbar\omega\,g_{s}(\omega)\,n_{B}(\omega)$ with $n_{B}=(e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1)^{-1}$. Low-$T$ acoustic modes $\Rightarrow$ **Debye law** $C_{V}\propto T^{3}$ in 3D; high $T$ $\Rightarrow$ Dulong–Petit $3Nk_{B}$ (see §9.6 for the full Debye integral). Optical modes add Schottky-like bumps when their gaps become thermally accessible.

---

### 10.2.7 Thermal transport: $\kappa$ from kinetic theory

In a crystal, heat is mostly carried by acoustic phonons. Kinetic theory gives

$$
\kappa = \frac{1}{3}\sum_{s}\int d\omega\; C_{\omega s}\,v_{g}^{2}(\omega,s)\,\tau(\omega,s)
$$

where $C_{\omega s}=\hbar\omega\,\partial n_{B}/\partial T$ is the mode heat capacity, $v_{g}=\partial\omega/\partial q$ the group velocity, and $\tau$ the lifetime. Scattering channels:

- **Phonon–phonon** (anharmonic). Split into **Normal (N)** processes conserving crystal momentum and **Umklapp (U)** with $\mathbf q_{1}+\mathbf q_{2}=\mathbf q_{3}+\mathbf G$ that degrade heat current  
- **Boundary** scattering (dominant in nanoscale or at very low $T$)  
- **Isotope/disorder** scattering  
- **Phonon–electron** and **phonon–defect** scattering in metals

Empirically, $\kappa(T)$ often rises as $\sim T^{3}$ at very low $T$ (ballistic/Boundary), peaks, then falls roughly as $1/T$ at high $T$ (Umklapp-limited).

---

### 10.2.8 Anharmonicity, frequency shifts, and lifetimes

Real crystals aren’t perfectly harmonic. Cubic and quartic terms cause:

- **Thermal expansion** (quasi-harmonic effect)  
- **Frequency renormalization** $\omega(\mathbf q,T)$  
- **Finite lifetimes** $\tau_{\mathbf q s}$ via three-phonon and four-phonon scattering

A handy bulk measure is the **Grüneisen parameter**

$$
\gamma_{\mathbf q s} \equiv -\frac{\partial \ln \omega_{\mathbf q s}}{\partial \ln V},\qquad
\gamma \equiv \frac{\sum_{\mathbf q s} \gamma_{\mathbf q s} C_{\mathbf q s}}{\sum_{\mathbf q s} C_{\mathbf q s}}
$$

The volumetric **thermal expansion coefficient** $\alpha$ relates to $\gamma$ and the bulk modulus $B$:

$$
\alpha = \frac{\gamma\,C_{V}}{B\,V}
$$

(Quasi-harmonic approximation; works surprisingly well for many simple solids.)

---

### 10.2.9 Electron–phonon coupling: the vibes behind resistivity and pairing

Displacements modulate the electronic Hamiltonian $H_{e}$, producing an interaction $H_{e\text{-}ph}$. Two archetypes:

- **Deformation potential** (short-range): $\delta V \sim \Xi\,\nabla\cdot \mathbf u$ couples to LA phonons  
- **Fröhlich** (long-range polar): in ionic crystals, LO phonons create macroscopic electric fields that couple strongly to electrons

Consequences:

- **Metal resistivity**: at low $T\ll \Theta_{D}$, Bloch–Grüneisen law $\rho \propto T^{5}$; at high $T$ roughly $\rho\propto T$  
- **Superconductivity**: virtual phonon exchange provides an effective attraction that can overcome Coulomb repulsion near the Fermi surface (BCS)

---

### 10.2.10 Instabilities and soft modes: Peierls in 1D

In 1D metals the electronic susceptibility peaks at $q=2k_{F}$. Electron–phonon coupling softens the phonon at that wavevector; below a critical $T$ the $\omega(2k_{F})\to 0$ **soft mode** drives a lattice distortion with doubled period (dimerization), opening a gap: a **Peierls transition**. In higher dimensions, charge-density waves and structural transitions follow similar logic.

---

### 10.2.11 Experimental fingerprints of phonons

- **Inelastic neutron scattering (INS)**: measures the dynamic structure factor $S(\mathbf q,\omega)$, mapping full $\omega(\mathbf q)$ and eigenvectors  
- **Raman spectroscopy**: probes zone-center optical phonons; symmetry selection rules apply  
- **Infrared (IR)** absorption/reflectivity: IR-active optical phonons in polar crystals split LO vs TO at $\Gamma$ (Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation)  
- **Brillouin light scattering**: accesses long-wavelength acoustic phonons (GHz)  
- **Specific heat** and **thermal conductivity** vs $T$: bulk thermodynamic signatures of DOS and scattering

---

### 10.2.12 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Group velocity in the monatomic chain**  
From $\omega(k)=2\sqrt{K/m}\,\left|\sin(ka/2)\right|$, compute $v_{g}(k)$ and show $v_{g}\to v_{s}=a\sqrt{K/m}$ as $k\to 0$.

**(b) DOS edge singularity**  
Use $g(\omega)=(L/\pi)/|d\omega/dk|$ to show the 1D DOS diverges at $k=\pi/a$.

**(c) Diatomic gap at $\Gamma$**  
Evaluate $\omega_{\text{opt}}(0)$ and $\omega_{\text{ac}}(0)$ for the diatomic chain and interpret the eigenvectors.

**(d) Debye $T^{3}$**  
Assuming three acoustic branches with linear dispersion up to a Debye cutoff $q_{D}$, integrate to get $C_{V}\propto T^{3}$ at low $T$.

**(e) Umklapp threshold**  
Show that an Umklapp process requires $\mathbf q_{1}+\mathbf q_{2}$ to leave the first BZ; estimate the minimum temperature where such $\mathbf q$ become thermally populated in a simple cubic with Debye wavevector $q_{D}$.

**(f) Thermal expansion from $\gamma$**  
Starting from $F(T,V)=U_{\text{el}}(V)+\sum_{\mathbf q s}\left[\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_{\mathbf q s} + k_{B}T\ln(1-e^{-\beta\hbar\omega_{\mathbf q s}})\right]$, show that $\alpha=\gamma C_{V}/(BV)$ in the quasi-harmonic approximation.

---

### 10.2.13 Common pitfalls

- **“Optical requires ions.”** No: you only need $r>1$ atoms per cell. **IR activity** requires polarity; optical phonons exist regardless  
- **Phase vs group velocity**: energy transport uses $v_{g}=\partial\omega/\partial k$, not $\omega/k$  
- **Forgetting selection rules**: Raman sees only Raman-active symmetries; IR sees IR-active modes; neutrons couple to nuclear positions and magnetic moments  
- **Mixing BZ schemes**: reduced vs extended zone pictures change where branches appear but not the physics  
- **Overusing harmonic approximation**: heat transport and expansion need anharmonicity; include N vs U processes when modeling $\kappa(T)$

---

### 10.2.14 Minimal problem kit

- Derive the monatomic and diatomic 1D dispersions and sketch both within the first BZ  
- Build a $6\times 6$ dynamical matrix for a 2-atom cubic basis with nearest-neighbor central forces and extract $\omega(\mathbf q)$ along a high-symmetry line  
- Compute $g(\omega)$ for a Debye model in $d=1,2,3$ and show the corresponding low-$T$ specific heat scalings  
- Use Matthiessen’s rule with boundary, isotope, and Umklapp scattering rates to fit a synthetic $\kappa(T)$ curve; identify the peak temperature scaling with sample size  
- Estimate the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature and the $T^{5}$ law crossover for a metal with given $v_{s}$ and $k_{F}$

---

**In summary:** Start with harmonic springs, diagonalize to get $\omega(\mathbf q)$, then quantize to phonons. Acoustic modes run the low-$T$ show and carry heat; optical modes decorate the mid-$T$ spectrum and light up in Raman/IR. Anharmonicity sets lifetimes, thermal expansion, and the fall of $\kappa(T)$. Couple to electrons and you get resistivity and, if you’re lucky, superconductivity. Same lattice, many vibes

## 10.3 Drude–Sommerfeld Metals

Metals look messy at the atomic scale, but their electrons act surprisingly lawful. **Drude** gave the first kinetic picture (1900): classical electrons as a gas of charged billiard balls with occasional collisions. **Sommerfeld** (1928) fixed the big misses using Fermi–Dirac statistics. Together they still power a shocking amount of metal physics: DC/AC conductivity, Hall effect, magnetotransport, specific heat, Pauli paramagnetism, and the Wiedemann–Franz law.

---

### 10.3.1 Drude model: one relaxation time, huge mileage

Assume conduction electrons of (effective) mass $m^{\ast}$ and charge $-e$ experience randomizing collisions with mean time $\tau$.

**Equation of motion (steady drive)** for average velocity $\mathbf v$ under fields $(\mathbf E,\mathbf B)$:

$$
m^{\ast}\,\frac{d\mathbf v}{dt} = -e\left(\mathbf E + \mathbf v\times \mathbf B\right) - \frac{m^{\ast}\mathbf v}{\tau}
$$

- **DC conductivity** at $B=0$ with current density $\mathbf J = -ne\,\mathbf v$:

$$
\sigma_{0} = \frac{ne^{2}\tau}{m^{\ast}},\qquad \rho_{0} \equiv \frac{1}{\sigma_{0}} = \frac{m^{\ast}}{ne^{2}\tau}
$$

Define **mobility** $\mu \equiv e\tau/m^{\ast}$ so $\sigma_{0}=ne\mu$.

- **AC (Drude) conductivity** for field $\propto e^{-i\omega t}$:

$$
\sigma(\omega) = \frac{\sigma_{0}}{1 - i\omega\tau}
$$

Real part is a Lorentzian of width $1/\tau$; imaginary part switches sign at $\omega\sim 1/\tau$.

- **Plasma frequency** (free-electron pole in optics):

$$
\omega_{p}^{2} = \frac{ne^{2}}{\varepsilon_{0} m^{\ast}}
$$

For $\omega\ll\omega_{p}$, metals reflect; for $\omega>\omega_{p}$, they transmit like a dielectric.

- **Skin depth** in the good-conductor limit ($\omega\tau\ll 1$):

$$
\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\mu_{0}\,\omega\,\sigma_{0}}}
$$

---

### 10.3.2 Hall effect and the conductivity tensor

With $\mathbf B = B\hat z$, the Drude solution gives the conductivity tensor

$$
\sigma = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\dfrac{\sigma_{0}}{1+(\omega_{c}\tau)^{2}} & \dfrac{\sigma_{0}\,\omega_{c}\tau}{1+(\omega_{c}\tau)^{2}} & 0 \\
-\dfrac{\sigma_{0}\,\omega_{c}\tau}{1+(\omega_{c}\tau)^{2}} & \dfrac{\sigma_{0}}{1+(\omega_{c}\tau)^{2}} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \sigma_{0}
\end{pmatrix},
\qquad
\omega_{c} \equiv \frac{eB}{m^{\ast}}
$$

Inverting gives the resistivity tensor. Two key outputs:

- **Hall coefficient** (weak field):

$$
R_{H} \equiv \frac{E_{y}}{J_{x}B} = -\,\frac{1}{ne}
$$

- **Magnetoresistance** in the **single-band, isotropic** Drude model is **zero**: $\rho_{xx}(B)=\rho_{0}$ despite $\sigma_{xx}$ shrinking, because the tensor inversion cancels it. Real materials show finite magnetoresistance due to multiple bands, anisotropy, or $\tau(\mathbf k)$ variations.

---

### 10.3.3 Drude thermal transport and Wiedemann–Franz (preview)

A simple kinetic estimate gives electronic thermal conductivity $\kappa_{e}\sim \tfrac{1}{3} C_{e} v_{F}^{2}\tau$ (once we introduce $v_{F}$). Drude naively predicts the **Wiedemann–Franz ratio**

$$
\frac{\kappa_{e}}{\sigma T} \equiv L \stackrel{?}{=}\text{const}
$$

But only with **Sommerfeld** statistics do we get the correct **Lorenz number**

$$
L_{0} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2}
$$

We’ll derive this properly after quantizing the electron gas.

### 10.3.4 The fix: Sommerfeld free-electron gas

Electrons are **fermions**. Put $N$ of them in a box of volume $V$ and fill momentum states up to the **Fermi sphere**.

- **Fermi wavevector and energy** (spin degeneracy $g=2$):

$$
k_{F} = \left(3\pi^{2} n\right)^{1/3},\qquad \epsilon_{F} = \frac{\hbar^{2} k_{F}^{2}}{2 m^{\ast}},\qquad v_{F}=\frac{\hbar k_{F}}{m^{\ast}}
$$

- **Density of states** per volume for a parabolic band:

$$
g(\epsilon) = \frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}\left(\frac{2m^{\ast}}{\hbar^{2}}\right)^{3/2}\sqrt{\epsilon}
$$

At low $T\ll T_{F}$, only a shell of width $\sim k_{B}T$ around $\epsilon_{F}$ is thermally active. This explains why most classical Drude thermodynamics failed.

### 10.3.5 Electronic specific heat: linear in $T$

Using Sommerfeld expansion,

$$
C_{e} = \gamma\,T,\qquad \gamma = \frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\,k_{B}^{2}\,g(\epsilon_{F})
$$

Linear $T$ matches experiments and is tiny compared to $3Nk_{B}$ at room temperature because only $\sim (T/T_{F})$ of electrons participate.

---

### 10.3.6 Wiedemann–Franz, done right

Kinetic theory with Fermi statistics yields

$$
\kappa_{e} = \frac{1}{3} v_{F}^{2}\tau\,C_{e}
$$

Combine with $\sigma_{0}=ne^{2}\tau/m^{\ast}$ and $n=\int^{\epsilon_{F}} g(\epsilon)\,d\epsilon$ to obtain, for elastic scattering with energy-independent $\tau$,

$$
\frac{\kappa_{e}}{\sigma T} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2} \equiv L_{0}
$$

Deviations of $L$ from $L_{0}$ diagnose inelastic scattering, strong energy dependence of $\tau$, or additional heat carriers (phonons, magnons).

### 10.3.7 Pauli paramagnetism and Landau diamagnetism (sketch)

- **Pauli paramagnetism** from spin polarization in a field $B$:

$$
\chi_{\text{Pauli}} = \mu_{0}\,\mu_{B}^{2}\,g(\epsilon_{F})
$$

Small, $T$-independent to leading order.

- **Landau diamagnetism** from orbital motion in quantizing fields gives

$$
\chi_{\text{Landau}} = -\frac{1}{3}\,\chi_{\text{Pauli}}
$$

for a free-electron gas. In real metals the net $\chi$ also includes core diamagnetism and possible Van Vleck terms.

### 10.3.8 Thermopower and the Mott formula (one-liner)

The Seebeck coefficient $S$ (voltage from a temperature gradient) vanishes in Drude’s classical picture but, with Fermi statistics,

$$
S = -\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\,\frac{k_{B}^{2}T}{e}\left.\frac{d\ln \sigma(\epsilon)}{d\epsilon}\right|_{\epsilon_{F}}
$$

This **Mott formula** makes $S$ a sensitive probe of particle–hole asymmetry and scattering near $\epsilon_{F}$.

---

### 10.3.9 What Drude gets wrong (and why Sommerfeld wins)

- **Heat capacity**: classical Drude predicts $C_{e}\sim Nk_{B}$; data show $C_{e}\propto T\ll Nk_{B}$. Sommerfeld fixes it.  
- **Hall sign**: single-band Drude gives $R_{H}=-1/ne$ (electrons). Many materials have **positive** $R_{H}$ due to hole-like Fermi surfaces or multiband compensation.  
- **Magnetoresistance**: zero in single-band Drude, but finite in reality from anisotropy, multiple pockets, or $\tau(\mathbf k)$.  
- **High-frequency optics**: Drude alone misses interband absorption and bound-charge contributions; add Lorentz oscillators for realistic $\varepsilon(\omega)$.

### 10.3.10 Connecting to band structure

Replace $m^{\ast}$ by the **band effective mass** from the dispersion $\epsilon(\mathbf k)$ near the Fermi surface:

$$
\frac{1}{m^{\ast}_{\alpha\beta}} = \frac{1}{\hbar^{2}}\left.\frac{\partial^{2}\epsilon(\mathbf k)}{\partial k_{\alpha}\,\partial k_{\beta}}\right|_{\mathbf k_{F}}
$$

Anisotropic $m^{\ast}$ makes $\sigma$ a tensor even at $B=0$. Real transport uses **Boltzmann** theory linearized around the Fermi surface with $\tau(\mathbf k)$ (see §10.7).

---

### 10.3.11 Optical sum rule and spectral weight

The f-sum rule ties the integrated Drude weight to carrier density:

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} d\omega\;\mathrm{Re}\,\sigma(\omega) = \frac{\pi ne^{2}}{2 m^{\ast}}
$$

In correlated systems, Drude weight can be suppressed and shifted to mid-infrared interband-like features—often read as a fingerprint of reduced quasiparticle weight.

### 10.3.12 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Numbers you can trust**  
Take $n=8.5\times 10^{28}\ \mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $\tau=3\times 10^{-14}\ \mathrm{s}$, $m^{\ast}=m_{e}$. Compute $\sigma_{0}$, $\rho_{0}$, $\omega_{p}$, and $\delta$ at $\omega/2\pi=10\ \mathrm{GHz}$.

**(b) Hall bar**  
For a sample with thickness $t$, width $w$, current $I$ along $x$, and field $B\hat z$, show the Hall voltage $V_{H} = I\,B/(ne\,t)$ in the Drude single-band limit. Estimate $V_{H}$ for copper with the numbers from (a).

**(c) Sommerfeld $C_{e}$**  
Derive $C_{e}=\gamma T$ using the Sommerfeld expansion and express $\gamma$ in terms of $n$ and $m^{\ast}$.

**(d) Wiedemann–Franz from Boltzmann**  
Linearize the Boltzmann equation with elastic impurity scattering and show $L=L_{0}$ when $\tau(\epsilon)$ is constant near $\epsilon_{F}$.

**(e) Mott thermopower sign**  
Assuming $\sigma(\epsilon)\propto \epsilon^{s}$ near $\epsilon_{F}$, show $S = -(\pi^{2}/3)(k_{B}^{2}T/e)\,s/\epsilon_{F}$ and interpret $S>0$ vs $S<0$.

### 10.3.13 Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting effective mass**: always use $m^{\ast}$ from the band structure, not bare $m_{e}$, in transport formulae.  
- **Reading magnetoresistance from $\sigma_{xx}$**: the measured $\rho_{xx}$ can be $B$-independent in single-band Drude even though $\sigma_{xx}$ shrinks; invert the tensor.  
- **Assuming $R_{H}=-1/ne$ universally**: multiband compensation and warped Fermi surfaces can flip the sign or reduce magnitude.  
- **Overusing constant $\tau$**: energy- or angle-dependent scattering changes $L$, $S$, and MR; be cautious outside low-$T$ impurity-limited regimes.  
- **Mixing optical and transport masses**: cyclotron, thermodynamic, and band masses can differ in anisotropic or interacting systems.

---

**In summary:** Drude nails the operational picture—current is charge density times mobility, with simple AC and Hall responses. Sommerfeld injects quantum statistics, unlocking the correct low-$T$ thermodynamics and the Wiedemann–Franz law. Dress both with band structure and you have a workhorse framework for normal-state metals, from DC resistivity to infrared optics
