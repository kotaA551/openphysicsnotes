## 10.1 Crystals & Reciprocal Space

Crystalline solids are periodic in space. Periodicity gives you enormous leverage: lattices turn sums into selection rules, Fourier transforms quantize $k$, and diffraction fingerprints structure. This section lays down the lattice–basis language, reciprocal vectors, Brillouin zones, Miller indices, and the diffraction toolkit (Bragg, Laue, Ewald, structure factors). We’ll tie together fcc/bcc duality, selection rules for common crystals, and quick ways to not get lost in indices.

### 10.1.1 Lattice, basis, crystal structure

A **Bravais lattice** is the set of points

$$
\mathbf R = n_{1}\,\mathbf a_{1} + n_{2}\,\mathbf a_{2} + n_{3}\,\mathbf a_{3},\qquad n_{i}\in\mathbb Z
$$

with three linearly independent **primitive vectors** $\mathbf a_{i}$. A **crystal structure** = lattice **plus** a basis of atoms at positions $\{\boldsymbol\tau_{j}\}$ inside a primitive cell; the atomic positions are $\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \boldsymbol\tau_{j}$.

- **Wigner–Seitz cell**: the set of points closer to a given lattice point than any other.  
- **Conventional vs primitive**: conventional cubic cells are nicer to look at; primitive cells are minimal-volume and great for theory.

**Pro tip**: never say “the diamond lattice.” Diamond has an **fcc lattice** with a two-point basis $\{(0,0,0),\,(\tfrac12,\tfrac12,\tfrac12)a\}$.

---

### 10.1.2 Symmetry: point groups and space groups (one-screenshot tour)

- **Point group**: rotations, reflections, inversion that leave at least one point fixed.  
- **Space group**: point-group ops + **translations** + **screw** rotations and **glide** reflections.  
- In 3D there are **14 Bravais lattices**, **32** crystallographic point groups, and **230** space groups. For band theory you mostly need the lattice and the little groups of high-symmetry $k$ points.

---

### 10.1.3 Reciprocal lattice and Brillouin zone

Define the **reciprocal primitive vectors** $\mathbf b_{i}$ by $\mathbf a_{i}\cdot \mathbf b_{j}=2\pi\delta_{ij}$. In vector form

$$
\mathbf b_{1} = 2\pi \frac{\mathbf a_{2}\times \mathbf a_{3}}{\mathbf a_{1}\cdot (\mathbf a_{2}\times \mathbf a_{3})},\quad
\mathbf b_{2} = 2\pi \frac{\mathbf a_{3}\times \mathbf a_{1}}{\mathbf a_{1}\cdot (\mathbf a_{2}\times \mathbf a_{3})},\quad
\mathbf b_{3} = 2\pi \frac{\mathbf a_{1}\times \mathbf a_{2}}{\mathbf a_{1}\cdot (\mathbf a_{2}\times \mathbf a_{3})}
$$

The **reciprocal lattice** consists of vectors $\mathbf G = h\,\mathbf b_{1} + k\,\mathbf b_{2} + \ell\,\mathbf b_{3}$ with integers $(h,k,\ell)$.

The **first Brillouin zone (BZ)** is the Wigner–Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice. It is the primitive cell in $k$-space and the natural domain for Bloch wavevectors.

- Duality: **fcc $\leftrightarrow$ bcc**. The reciprocal of fcc is bcc and vice versa. Simple cubic is self-dual.

---

### 10.1.4 Bloch theorem in one line

In a periodic potential $V(\mathbf r+\mathbf R)=V(\mathbf r)$, single-particle eigenstates are **Bloch waves**:

$$
\psi_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r) = e^{i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf r}\,u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r),\qquad u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r+\mathbf R) = u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r)
$$

Wavevectors $\mathbf k$ can be chosen in the first BZ. Translating $\mathbf k\to \mathbf k+\mathbf G$ leaves physics invariant.

---

### 10.1.5 Planes, directions, and indices (Miller crash course)

- **Directions** use square brackets $[u\,v\,w]$ for a lattice vector proportional to $u\,\mathbf a_{1}+v\,\mathbf a_{2}+w\,\mathbf a_{3}$. Families of equivalent directions: $\langle u\,v\,w\rangle$.  
- **Planes** use parentheses $(h\,k\,\ell)$, the **Miller indices**, defined as reciprocals of intercepts along $\mathbf a_{i}$. Families: $\{h\,k\,\ell\}$.  
- **Spacing** to plane family $(h\,k\,\ell)$ is tied to the reciprocal vector $\mathbf G_{hkl}$:

$$
\mathbf G_{hkl} = h\,\mathbf b_{1} + k\,\mathbf b_{2} + \ell\,\mathbf b_{3}
$$

$$
d_{hkl} = \frac{2\pi}{|\mathbf G_{hkl}|}
$$

For **cubic** $a_{1}=a\,\hat x$ etc., $d_{hkl}= a/\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+\ell^{2}}$.

**Hexagonal** often uses Miller–Bravais $(h\,k\,i\,\ell)$ with $i=-(h+k)$ to make basal-plane symmetry manifest.

---

### 10.1.6 Diffraction: Bragg, Laue, Ewald are the same vibe

Elastic scattering conserves $|\mathbf k|=|\mathbf k'|$ and transfers crystal momentum $\Delta\mathbf k=\mathbf k'-\mathbf k$ equal to a reciprocal vector:

$$
\Delta \mathbf k = \mathbf G
$$

**Bragg condition** in real space:

$$
2 d_{hkl}\,\sin\theta = n\,\lambda
$$

**Laue condition** in $k$-space is exactly $\mathbf k'-\mathbf k=\mathbf G$. **Ewald sphere** construction: draw a sphere of radius $|\mathbf k|=2\pi/\lambda$ anchored at the tail of $\mathbf k$; reciprocal-lattice points on the sphere give allowed reflections.

**Structure factor** encodes the basis:

$$
F(\mathbf G) = \sum_{j=1}^{m} f_{j}\,e^{-i\mathbf G\cdot \boldsymbol\tau_{j}}
$$

with atomic form factors $f_{j}$. The diffracted intensity is

$$
I(\mathbf G) \propto |F(\mathbf G)|^{2}
$$

The lattice sum enforces $\mathbf G$ belongs to the reciprocal lattice; $F$ decides if it actually lights up.

---

### 10.1.7 Selection rules for common structures

- **Simple cubic (sc)** with one atom at $(0,0,0)$:

$$
F(\mathbf G)=f,\quad \text{no systematic absences}
$$

- **Body-centered cubic (bcc)**, basis $\{(0,0,0),\,(\tfrac12,\tfrac12,\tfrac12)a\}$:

$$
F = f\left[1 + e^{-i\pi(h+k+\ell)}\right] = 
\begin{cases}
2f & h+k+\ell\ \text{even} \\
0 & h+k+\ell\ \text{odd}
\end{cases}
$$

- **Face-centered cubic (fcc)**, basis $\{(0,0,0),\,(\tfrac12,\tfrac12,0)a,\,(\tfrac12,0,\tfrac12)a,\,(0,\tfrac12,\tfrac12)a\}$:

$$
F = f\left[1 + e^{-i\pi(h+k)} + e^{-i\pi(h+\ell)} + e^{-i\pi(k+\ell)}\right] =
\begin{cases}
4f & h,k,\ell\ \text{all even or all odd} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

- **NaCl (rock salt)**: fcc lattice with two-species basis $\{(0,0,0)\ \text{Na},\ (\tfrac12,\tfrac12,\tfrac12)a\ \text{Cl}\}$. Then

$$
F = f_{\mathrm{Na}} + f_{\mathrm{Cl}}\,e^{-i\pi(h+k+\ell)}
$$

Intensity alternates with $h+k+\ell$ depending on $f$-contrast.

- **Diamond**: fcc lattice with basis $\{(0,0,0),\,(\tfrac14,\tfrac14,\tfrac14)a\}$. Extra phase leads to additional systematic zeros beyond fcc.

---

### 10.1.8 fcc–bcc duality and high-symmetry $k$ points

If $\{\mathbf a_{i}\}$ are **fcc** vectors, the reciprocal $\{\mathbf b_{i}\}$ generate a **bcc** lattice in $k$-space (and vice versa). Learn the standard labels:

- **fcc BZ**: $\Gamma$ center, $X$ at face centers, $L$ at BZ corners, $W$ mid-edges.  
- **bcc BZ**: $\Gamma$, $H$, $N$, $P$ points.  

These are where band extrema and degeneracies love to appear and where experimentalists measure ARPES and quantum oscillations.

---

### 10.1.9 Real ↔ reciprocal geometry cheats

- **Volume relation**:

$$
V_{\mathrm{cell}}\,V_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\ast} = (2\pi)^{3}
$$

- **Plane normal**: the reciprocal vector $\mathbf G_{hkl}$ is **normal** to the $(hkl)$ planes.  
- **Angle between planes** $(h_{1}k_{1}\ell_{1})$ and $(h_{2}k_{2}\ell_{2})$:

$$
\cos\theta = \frac{\mathbf G_{1}\cdot \mathbf G_{2}}{|\mathbf G_{1}|\,|\mathbf G_{2}|}
$$

- **Spacing** again: $d_{hkl}=2\pi/|\mathbf G_{hkl}|$.

---

### 10.1.10 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Reciprocal of bcc is fcc**  
Start with bcc conventional cubic cell of side $a$ and primitive vectors $\mathbf a_{1}=\tfrac a2(\hat y+\hat z-\hat x)$ etc. Compute $\mathbf b_{i}$ and show the reciprocal points sit at face centers of a cubic net with spacing $2\pi/a$.

**(b) $d_{hkl}$ for cubic**  
Using $\mathbf G_{hkl}=(2\pi/a)(h\,\hat x + k\,\hat y + \ell\,\hat z)$, show $d_{hkl}=a/\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+\ell^{2}}$. Bragg gives $2d\sin\theta=n\lambda$; solve for the $(111)$ first-order reflection angle for given $\lambda/a$.

**(c) fcc systematic absences**  
Evaluate $F$ for $(100)$, $(110)$, $(111)$ families and confirm only “all even” or “all odd” survive.

**(d) Diamond zeros**  
Diamond has $F \propto \left[1 + e^{-i\pi(h+k+\ell)/2}\right]\times(\text{fcc factor})$. Show that $(222)$ is extinct but $(111)$ is allowed, consistent with X-ray tables.

**(e) Ewald construction sketch**  
For $\lambda=1.54\ \text{\AA}$ (Cu K$\alpha$), draw a circle of radius $2\pi/\lambda$ through the origin of the reciprocal fcc lattice and mark which $\mathbf G$ vectors on the circle predict reflections for a given crystal orientation.

---

### 10.1.11 Common pitfalls

- **Confusing lattice with structure**: lattice is the periodic scaffold; the **basis** puts atoms on it.  
- **Wrong units in reciprocal space**: crystallographers often use $2\pi$-free convention; here $a_{i}\cdot b_{j}=2\pi\delta_{ij}$. Pick one and stay loyal.  
- **Miller vs direction indices**: $(hkl)$ is a plane, $[uvw]$ is a direction. For cubic, $(hkl)\perp [hkl]$; not true in general.  
- **Forgetting the form factor**: even if $F\neq 0$, $f_{j}(\mathbf G)$ decays with $|\mathbf G|$, reshaping intensities.  
- **BZ confusion**: the “reduced zone” scheme folds $k$ into the first BZ; if bands look doubled, you probably mixed extended vs reduced plots.

---

### 10.1.12 Minimal problem kit

- Derive the reciprocal vectors $\mathbf b_{i}$ from $\mathbf a_{i}$ and prove $V_{\mathrm{cell}}\,V_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\ast}=(2\pi)^{3}$  
- Show that the Laue condition $\mathbf k'-\mathbf k=\mathbf G$ and Bragg’s law $2d\sin\theta=n\lambda$ are equivalent via $\mathbf G$ geometry  
- Compute the structure factor and selection rules for NaCl and CsCl; compare which $(hkl)$ vanish in each  
- For a hexagonal lattice with $a$ and $c$, write $\mathbf b_{i}$ and obtain $d_{hkl}$ in terms of $(h\,k\,i\,\ell)$  
- Locate the high-symmetry points $\Gamma$, $X$, $L$, $W$ for fcc in Cartesian $k$-coordinates given $a$, and sketch the first BZ

---

**In summary:** Lattice periodicity turns real-space order into reciprocal-space selection. The reciprocal lattice and the first Brillouin zone are not optional—they’re the natural stage for electrons, phonons, and diffraction. Master $\mathbf a$/$\mathbf b$, $(hkl)$/$[uvw]$, and $F(\mathbf G)$ once, and you’ll read both band structures and diffraction patterns like a native

## 10.2 Lattice Vibrations & Phonons

Atoms in a crystal aren’t statues; they wiggle. Those collective wiggles are **phonons**: quantized normal modes of the lattice. In this section we go from 1D chains to full 3D dynamical matrices, split **acoustic** vs **optical** branches, compute dispersions, group velocities, and densities of states, then quantize. We also hit thermal transport, anharmonicity, thermal expansion via the Grüneisen parameter, electron–phonon coupling, and quick experimental fingerprints (neutron, Raman, IR).

---

### 10.2.1 Harmonic lattice: setting the stage

Let $\mathbf R$ label Bravais sites and $\kappa$ the basis atom index inside a unit cell. The displacement of atom $(\mathbf R,\kappa)$ is $\mathbf u_{\kappa}(\mathbf R,t)$. In the **harmonic** approximation the potential energy is quadratic in displacements:

$$
U = \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{\mathbf R\kappa\alpha}\sum_{\mathbf R'\kappa'\beta}
\Phi_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R-\mathbf R')\,u_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf R)\,u_{\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R')
$$

where $\Phi$ are **force constants** and $\alpha,\beta\in\{x,y,z\}$. Newton:

$$
M_{\kappa}\,\ddot u_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf R,t) = -\sum_{\mathbf R'\kappa'\beta} \Phi_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R-\mathbf R')\,u_{\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R',t)
$$

Try plane-wave solutions $u_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf R,t)=e_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf q)\,e^{i(\mathbf q\cdot \mathbf R - \omega t)}$. You get an eigenproblem

$$
\sum_{\kappa'\beta} D_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf q)\,e_{\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf q) = \omega^{2}(\mathbf q)\,e_{\kappa\alpha}(\mathbf q)
$$

with the **dynamical matrix**

$$
D_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{\kappa}M_{\kappa'}}}
\sum_{\mathbf R} \Phi_{\kappa\alpha,\kappa'\beta}(\mathbf R)\,e^{i\mathbf q\cdot \mathbf R}
$$

For $r$ atoms per cell you get $3r$ branches: 3 acoustic $\omega\to 0$ as $\mathbf q\to 0$, and $3r-3$ optical.

---

### 10.2.2 1D monatomic chain: the cleanest demo

Masses $m$ connected by springs $K$ with lattice spacing $a$. Let $u_{n}$ be the displacement of site $n$. Equation of motion:

$$
m\,\ddot u_{n} = K\,(u_{n+1} - 2u_{n} + u_{n-1})
$$

Ansatz $u_{n}=u_{0}e^{i(nka-\omega t)}$ gives the dispersion

$$
\omega(k) = 2\sqrt{\frac{K}{m}}\;\left|\sin\frac{ka}{2}\right|
$$

Key takeaways:

- **Acoustic** branch only, linear near $k=0$ with sound speed $v_{s}=a\sqrt{K/m}$  
- **Brillouin zone** is $-\pi/a<k\le \pi/a$; $\omega(k)$ is periodic with $2\pi/a$  
- **Group velocity** $v_{g}(k)=\partial\omega/\partial k$ controls energy flow

**Density of states** in 1D for a single branch:

$$
g(\omega) = \frac{L}{\pi}\,\frac{1}{|d\omega/dk|}
$$

So $g(\omega)$ diverges at BZ edges where $d\omega/dk\to 0$ (van Hove singularity).

---

### 10.2.3 1D diatomic chain: acoustic + optical

Two alternating masses $m_{1},m_{2}$, same spring $K$, unit cell length $a$ containing both atoms. With nearest-neighbor coupling, the two-branch dispersion is

$$
\omega^{2}(k) = K\left(\frac{1}{m_{1}}+\frac{1}{m_{2}}\right)
\pm \sqrt{K^{2}\left(\frac{1}{m_{1}}+\frac{1}{m_{2}}\right)^{2} - \frac{4K^{2}}{m_{1}m_{2}}\sin^{2}\!\frac{ka}{2}}
$$

- The **minus** sign is the **acoustic** branch with $\omega\to 0$ as $k\to 0$  
- The **plus** sign is the **optical** branch with $\omega(k=0)=\sqrt{2K(1/m_{1}+1/m_{2})}$

At $k=0$ the acoustic mode moves the two atoms **in phase**; the optical mode moves them **out of phase**. A **gap** opens at the zone boundary.

---

### 10.2.4 3D crystals: polarizations and sound speeds

For $r=1$ (monatomic Bravais) you have 3 acoustic branches: one **longitudinal** (LA) and two **transverse** (TA). Near $\mathbf q=0$ they are **sound waves** with linear dispersion

$$
\omega_{\text{LA}}(\mathbf q) \approx v_{L}|\mathbf q|,\qquad \omega_{\text{TA}}(\mathbf q) \approx v_{T}|\mathbf q|
$$

In cubic crystals the speeds relate to elastic constants and mass density $\rho$ (continuum limit):

$$
v_{L} = \sqrt{\frac{C_{11}}{\rho}},\qquad v_{T} = \sqrt{\frac{C_{44}}{\rho}}
$$

More generally, the Christoffel equation gives direction-dependent velocities.

For $r>1$ you add $3r-3$ **optical** branches that typically have weak $\mathbf q$-dispersion near the zone center. If the basis carries opposite charges, some optical modes are **IR active** (see §10.14).

---

### 10.2.5 Quantization: phonons as bosons

Promote each normal mode $(\mathbf q,s)$ to a harmonic oscillator:

$$
H = \sum_{\mathbf q,s} \hbar\omega_{\mathbf q s}\left(b^{\dagger}_{\mathbf q s} b_{\mathbf q s} + \tfrac{1}{2}\right)
$$

with $[b_{\mathbf q s},b^{\dagger}_{\mathbf q' s'}]=\delta_{\mathbf q\mathbf q'}\delta_{ss'}$. The displacement operator is

$$
\mathbf u_{\kappa}(\mathbf R) = \sum_{\mathbf q,s} \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M_{\kappa} N \omega_{\mathbf q s}}}\;
\mathbf e_{\kappa s}(\mathbf q)\,\left(b_{\mathbf q s} e^{i\mathbf q\cdot \mathbf R} + b^{\dagger}_{\mathbf q s} e^{-i\mathbf q\cdot \mathbf R}\right)
$$

Phonon occupation follows Bose statistics with chemical potential $\mu=0$ in equilibrium.

---

### 10.2.6 Heat capacity and Debye revisit

Total phonon energy per volume $U/V=\sum_{s}\int d\omega\,\hbar\omega\,g_{s}(\omega)\,n_{B}(\omega)$ with $n_{B}=(e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1)^{-1}$. Low-$T$ acoustic modes $\Rightarrow$ **Debye law** $C_{V}\propto T^{3}$ in 3D; high $T$ $\Rightarrow$ Dulong–Petit $3Nk_{B}$ (see §9.6 for the full Debye integral). Optical modes add Schottky-like bumps when their gaps become thermally accessible.

---

### 10.2.7 Thermal transport: $\kappa$ from kinetic theory

In a crystal, heat is mostly carried by acoustic phonons. Kinetic theory gives

$$
\kappa = \frac{1}{3}\sum_{s}\int d\omega\; C_{\omega s}\,v_{g}^{2}(\omega,s)\,\tau(\omega,s)
$$

where $C_{\omega s}=\hbar\omega\,\partial n_{B}/\partial T$ is the mode heat capacity, $v_{g}=\partial\omega/\partial q$ the group velocity, and $\tau$ the lifetime. Scattering channels:

- **Phonon–phonon** (anharmonic). Split into **Normal (N)** processes conserving crystal momentum and **Umklapp (U)** with $\mathbf q_{1}+\mathbf q_{2}=\mathbf q_{3}+\mathbf G$ that degrade heat current  
- **Boundary** scattering (dominant in nanoscale or at very low $T$)  
- **Isotope/disorder** scattering  
- **Phonon–electron** and **phonon–defect** scattering in metals

Empirically, $\kappa(T)$ often rises as $\sim T^{3}$ at very low $T$ (ballistic/Boundary), peaks, then falls roughly as $1/T$ at high $T$ (Umklapp-limited).

---

### 10.2.8 Anharmonicity, frequency shifts, and lifetimes

Real crystals aren’t perfectly harmonic. Cubic and quartic terms cause:

- **Thermal expansion** (quasi-harmonic effect)  
- **Frequency renormalization** $\omega(\mathbf q,T)$  
- **Finite lifetimes** $\tau_{\mathbf q s}$ via three-phonon and four-phonon scattering

A handy bulk measure is the **Grüneisen parameter**

$$
\gamma_{\mathbf q s} \equiv -\frac{\partial \ln \omega_{\mathbf q s}}{\partial \ln V},\qquad
\gamma \equiv \frac{\sum_{\mathbf q s} \gamma_{\mathbf q s} C_{\mathbf q s}}{\sum_{\mathbf q s} C_{\mathbf q s}}
$$

The volumetric **thermal expansion coefficient** $\alpha$ relates to $\gamma$ and the bulk modulus $B$:

$$
\alpha = \frac{\gamma\,C_{V}}{B\,V}
$$

(Quasi-harmonic approximation; works surprisingly well for many simple solids.)

---

### 10.2.9 Electron–phonon coupling: the vibes behind resistivity and pairing

Displacements modulate the electronic Hamiltonian $H_{e}$, producing an interaction $H_{e\text{-}ph}$. Two archetypes:

- **Deformation potential** (short-range): $\delta V \sim \Xi\,\nabla\cdot \mathbf u$ couples to LA phonons  
- **Fröhlich** (long-range polar): in ionic crystals, LO phonons create macroscopic electric fields that couple strongly to electrons

Consequences:

- **Metal resistivity**: at low $T\ll \Theta_{D}$, Bloch–Grüneisen law $\rho \propto T^{5}$; at high $T$ roughly $\rho\propto T$  
- **Superconductivity**: virtual phonon exchange provides an effective attraction that can overcome Coulomb repulsion near the Fermi surface (BCS)

---

### 10.2.10 Instabilities and soft modes: Peierls in 1D

In 1D metals the electronic susceptibility peaks at $q=2k_{F}$. Electron–phonon coupling softens the phonon at that wavevector; below a critical $T$ the $\omega(2k_{F})\to 0$ **soft mode** drives a lattice distortion with doubled period (dimerization), opening a gap: a **Peierls transition**. In higher dimensions, charge-density waves and structural transitions follow similar logic.

---

### 10.2.11 Experimental fingerprints of phonons

- **Inelastic neutron scattering (INS)**: measures the dynamic structure factor $S(\mathbf q,\omega)$, mapping full $\omega(\mathbf q)$ and eigenvectors  
- **Raman spectroscopy**: probes zone-center optical phonons; symmetry selection rules apply  
- **Infrared (IR)** absorption/reflectivity: IR-active optical phonons in polar crystals split LO vs TO at $\Gamma$ (Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation)  
- **Brillouin light scattering**: accesses long-wavelength acoustic phonons (GHz)  
- **Specific heat** and **thermal conductivity** vs $T$: bulk thermodynamic signatures of DOS and scattering

---

### 10.2.12 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Group velocity in the monatomic chain**  
From $\omega(k)=2\sqrt{K/m}\,\left|\sin(ka/2)\right|$, compute $v_{g}(k)$ and show $v_{g}\to v_{s}=a\sqrt{K/m}$ as $k\to 0$.

**(b) DOS edge singularity**  
Use $g(\omega)=(L/\pi)/|d\omega/dk|$ to show the 1D DOS diverges at $k=\pi/a$.

**(c) Diatomic gap at $\Gamma$**  
Evaluate $\omega_{\text{opt}}(0)$ and $\omega_{\text{ac}}(0)$ for the diatomic chain and interpret the eigenvectors.

**(d) Debye $T^{3}$**  
Assuming three acoustic branches with linear dispersion up to a Debye cutoff $q_{D}$, integrate to get $C_{V}\propto T^{3}$ at low $T$.

**(e) Umklapp threshold**  
Show that an Umklapp process requires $\mathbf q_{1}+\mathbf q_{2}$ to leave the first BZ; estimate the minimum temperature where such $\mathbf q$ become thermally populated in a simple cubic with Debye wavevector $q_{D}$.

**(f) Thermal expansion from $\gamma$**  
Starting from $F(T,V)=U_{\text{el}}(V)+\sum_{\mathbf q s}\left[\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_{\mathbf q s} + k_{B}T\ln(1-e^{-\beta\hbar\omega_{\mathbf q s}})\right]$, show that $\alpha=\gamma C_{V}/(BV)$ in the quasi-harmonic approximation.

---

### 10.2.13 Common pitfalls

- **“Optical requires ions.”** No: you only need $r>1$ atoms per cell. **IR activity** requires polarity; optical phonons exist regardless  
- **Phase vs group velocity**: energy transport uses $v_{g}=\partial\omega/\partial k$, not $\omega/k$  
- **Forgetting selection rules**: Raman sees only Raman-active symmetries; IR sees IR-active modes; neutrons couple to nuclear positions and magnetic moments  
- **Mixing BZ schemes**: reduced vs extended zone pictures change where branches appear but not the physics  
- **Overusing harmonic approximation**: heat transport and expansion need anharmonicity; include N vs U processes when modeling $\kappa(T)$

---

### 10.2.14 Minimal problem kit

- Derive the monatomic and diatomic 1D dispersions and sketch both within the first BZ  
- Build a $6\times 6$ dynamical matrix for a 2-atom cubic basis with nearest-neighbor central forces and extract $\omega(\mathbf q)$ along a high-symmetry line  
- Compute $g(\omega)$ for a Debye model in $d=1,2,3$ and show the corresponding low-$T$ specific heat scalings  
- Use Matthiessen’s rule with boundary, isotope, and Umklapp scattering rates to fit a synthetic $\kappa(T)$ curve; identify the peak temperature scaling with sample size  
- Estimate the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature and the $T^{5}$ law crossover for a metal with given $v_{s}$ and $k_{F}$

---

**In summary:** Start with harmonic springs, diagonalize to get $\omega(\mathbf q)$, then quantize to phonons. Acoustic modes run the low-$T$ show and carry heat; optical modes decorate the mid-$T$ spectrum and light up in Raman/IR. Anharmonicity sets lifetimes, thermal expansion, and the fall of $\kappa(T)$. Couple to electrons and you get resistivity and, if you’re lucky, superconductivity. Same lattice, many vibes

## 10.3 Drude–Sommerfeld Metals

Metals look messy at the atomic scale, but their electrons act surprisingly lawful. **Drude** gave the first kinetic picture (1900): classical electrons as a gas of charged billiard balls with occasional collisions. **Sommerfeld** (1928) fixed the big misses using Fermi–Dirac statistics. Together they still power a shocking amount of metal physics: DC/AC conductivity, Hall effect, magnetotransport, specific heat, Pauli paramagnetism, and the Wiedemann–Franz law.

---

### 10.3.1 Drude model: one relaxation time, huge mileage

Assume conduction electrons of (effective) mass $m^{\ast}$ and charge $-e$ experience randomizing collisions with mean time $\tau$.

**Equation of motion (steady drive)** for average velocity $\mathbf v$ under fields $(\mathbf E,\mathbf B)$:

$$
m^{\ast}\,\frac{d\mathbf v}{dt} = -e\left(\mathbf E + \mathbf v\times \mathbf B\right) - \frac{m^{\ast}\mathbf v}{\tau}
$$

- **DC conductivity** at $B=0$ with current density $\mathbf J = -ne\,\mathbf v$:

$$
\sigma_{0} = \frac{ne^{2}\tau}{m^{\ast}},\qquad \rho_{0} \equiv \frac{1}{\sigma_{0}} = \frac{m^{\ast}}{ne^{2}\tau}
$$

Define **mobility** $\mu \equiv e\tau/m^{\ast}$ so $\sigma_{0}=ne\mu$.

- **AC (Drude) conductivity** for field $\propto e^{-i\omega t}$:

$$
\sigma(\omega) = \frac{\sigma_{0}}{1 - i\omega\tau}
$$

Real part is a Lorentzian of width $1/\tau$; imaginary part switches sign at $\omega\sim 1/\tau$.

- **Plasma frequency** (free-electron pole in optics):

$$
\omega_{p}^{2} = \frac{ne^{2}}{\varepsilon_{0} m^{\ast}}
$$

For $\omega\ll\omega_{p}$, metals reflect; for $\omega>\omega_{p}$, they transmit like a dielectric.

- **Skin depth** in the good-conductor limit ($\omega\tau\ll 1$):

$$
\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\mu_{0}\,\omega\,\sigma_{0}}}
$$

---

### 10.3.2 Hall effect and the conductivity tensor

With $\mathbf B = B\hat z$, the Drude solution gives the conductivity tensor

$$
\sigma = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\dfrac{\sigma_{0}}{1+(\omega_{c}\tau)^{2}} & \dfrac{\sigma_{0}\,\omega_{c}\tau}{1+(\omega_{c}\tau)^{2}} & 0 \\
-\dfrac{\sigma_{0}\,\omega_{c}\tau}{1+(\omega_{c}\tau)^{2}} & \dfrac{\sigma_{0}}{1+(\omega_{c}\tau)^{2}} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \sigma_{0}
\end{pmatrix},
\qquad
\omega_{c} \equiv \frac{eB}{m^{\ast}}
$$

Inverting gives the resistivity tensor. Two key outputs:

- **Hall coefficient** (weak field):

$$
R_{H} \equiv \frac{E_{y}}{J_{x}B} = -\,\frac{1}{ne}
$$

- **Magnetoresistance** in the **single-band, isotropic** Drude model is **zero**: $\rho_{xx}(B)=\rho_{0}$ despite $\sigma_{xx}$ shrinking, because the tensor inversion cancels it. Real materials show finite magnetoresistance due to multiple bands, anisotropy, or $\tau(\mathbf k)$ variations.

---

### 10.3.3 Drude thermal transport and Wiedemann–Franz (preview)

A simple kinetic estimate gives electronic thermal conductivity $\kappa_{e}\sim \tfrac{1}{3} C_{e} v_{F}^{2}\tau$ (once we introduce $v_{F}$). Drude naively predicts the **Wiedemann–Franz ratio**

$$
\frac{\kappa_{e}}{\sigma T} \equiv L \stackrel{?}{=}\text{const}
$$

But only with **Sommerfeld** statistics do we get the correct **Lorenz number**

$$
L_{0} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2}
$$

We’ll derive this properly after quantizing the electron gas.

### 10.3.4 The fix: Sommerfeld free-electron gas

Electrons are **fermions**. Put $N$ of them in a box of volume $V$ and fill momentum states up to the **Fermi sphere**.

- **Fermi wavevector and energy** (spin degeneracy $g=2$):

$$
k_{F} = \left(3\pi^{2} n\right)^{1/3},\qquad \epsilon_{F} = \frac{\hbar^{2} k_{F}^{2}}{2 m^{\ast}},\qquad v_{F}=\frac{\hbar k_{F}}{m^{\ast}}
$$

- **Density of states** per volume for a parabolic band:

$$
g(\epsilon) = \frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}\left(\frac{2m^{\ast}}{\hbar^{2}}\right)^{3/2}\sqrt{\epsilon}
$$

At low $T\ll T_{F}$, only a shell of width $\sim k_{B}T$ around $\epsilon_{F}$ is thermally active. This explains why most classical Drude thermodynamics failed.

---

### 10.3.5 Electronic specific heat: linear in $T$

Using Sommerfeld expansion,

$$
C_{e} = \gamma\,T,\qquad \gamma = \frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\,k_{B}^{2}\,g(\epsilon_{F})
$$

Linear $T$ matches experiments and is tiny compared to $3Nk_{B}$ at room temperature because only $\sim (T/T_{F})$ of electrons participate.

---

### 10.3.6 Wiedemann–Franz, done right

Kinetic theory with Fermi statistics yields

$$
\kappa_{e} = \frac{1}{3} v_{F}^{2}\tau\,C_{e}
$$

Combine with $\sigma_{0}=ne^{2}\tau/m^{\ast}$ and $n=\int^{\epsilon_{F}} g(\epsilon)\,d\epsilon$ to obtain, for elastic scattering with energy-independent $\tau$,

$$
\frac{\kappa_{e}}{\sigma T} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2} \equiv L_{0}
$$

Deviations of $L$ from $L_{0}$ diagnose inelastic scattering, strong energy dependence of $\tau$, or additional heat carriers (phonons, magnons).

---

### 10.3.7 Pauli paramagnetism and Landau diamagnetism (sketch)

- **Pauli paramagnetism** from spin polarization in a field $B$:

$$
\chi_{\text{Pauli}} = \mu_{0}\,\mu_{B}^{2}\,g(\epsilon_{F})
$$

Small, $T$-independent to leading order.

- **Landau diamagnetism** from orbital motion in quantizing fields gives

$$
\chi_{\text{Landau}} = -\frac{1}{3}\,\chi_{\text{Pauli}}
$$

for a free-electron gas. In real metals the net $\chi$ also includes core diamagnetism and possible Van Vleck terms.

---

### 10.3.8 Thermopower and the Mott formula (one-liner)

The Seebeck coefficient $S$ (voltage from a temperature gradient) vanishes in Drude’s classical picture but, with Fermi statistics,

$$
S = -\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\,\frac{k_{B}^{2}T}{e}\left.\frac{d\ln \sigma(\epsilon)}{d\epsilon}\right|_{\epsilon_{F}}
$$

This **Mott formula** makes $S$ a sensitive probe of particle–hole asymmetry and scattering near $\epsilon_{F}$.

---

### 10.3.9 What Drude gets wrong (and why Sommerfeld wins)

- **Heat capacity**: classical Drude predicts $C_{e}\sim Nk_{B}$; data show $C_{e}\propto T\ll Nk_{B}$. Sommerfeld fixes it.  
- **Hall sign**: single-band Drude gives $R_{H}=-1/ne$ (electrons). Many materials have **positive** $R_{H}$ due to hole-like Fermi surfaces or multiband compensation.  
- **Magnetoresistance**: zero in single-band Drude, but finite in reality from anisotropy, multiple pockets, or $\tau(\mathbf k)$.  
- **High-frequency optics**: Drude alone misses interband absorption and bound-charge contributions; add Lorentz oscillators for realistic $\varepsilon(\omega)$.

---

### 10.3.10 Connecting to band structure

Replace $m^{\ast}$ by the **band effective mass** from the dispersion $\epsilon(\mathbf k)$ near the Fermi surface:

$$
\frac{1}{m^{\ast}_{\alpha\beta}} = \frac{1}{\hbar^{2}}\left.\frac{\partial^{2}\epsilon(\mathbf k)}{\partial k_{\alpha}\,\partial k_{\beta}}\right|_{\mathbf k_{F}}
$$

Anisotropic $m^{\ast}$ makes $\sigma$ a tensor even at $B=0$. Real transport uses **Boltzmann** theory linearized around the Fermi surface with $\tau(\mathbf k)$ (see §10.7).

---

### 10.3.11 Optical sum rule and spectral weight

The f-sum rule ties the integrated Drude weight to carrier density:

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} d\omega\;\mathrm{Re}\,\sigma(\omega) = \frac{\pi ne^{2}}{2 m^{\ast}}
$$

In correlated systems, Drude weight can be suppressed and shifted to mid-infrared interband-like features—often read as a fingerprint of reduced quasiparticle weight.

---

### 10.3.12 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Numbers you can trust**  
Take $n=8.5\times 10^{28}\ \mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $\tau=3\times 10^{-14}\ \mathrm{s}$, $m^{\ast}=m_{e}$. Compute $\sigma_{0}$, $\rho_{0}$, $\omega_{p}$, and $\delta$ at $\omega/2\pi=10\ \mathrm{GHz}$.

**(b) Hall bar**  
For a sample with thickness $t$, width $w$, current $I$ along $x$, and field $B\hat z$, show the Hall voltage $V_{H} = I\,B/(ne\,t)$ in the Drude single-band limit. Estimate $V_{H}$ for copper with the numbers from (a).

**(c) Sommerfeld $C_{e}$**  
Derive $C_{e}=\gamma T$ using the Sommerfeld expansion and express $\gamma$ in terms of $n$ and $m^{\ast}$.

**(d) Wiedemann–Franz from Boltzmann**  
Linearize the Boltzmann equation with elastic impurity scattering and show $L=L_{0}$ when $\tau(\epsilon)$ is constant near $\epsilon_{F}$.

**(e) Mott thermopower sign**  
Assuming $\sigma(\epsilon)\propto \epsilon^{s}$ near $\epsilon_{F}$, show $S = -(\pi^{2}/3)(k_{B}^{2}T/e)\,s/\epsilon_{F}$ and interpret $S>0$ vs $S<0$.

---

### 10.3.13 Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting effective mass**: always use $m^{\ast}$ from the band structure, not bare $m_{e}$, in transport formulae.  
- **Reading magnetoresistance from $\sigma_{xx}$**: the measured $\rho_{xx}$ can be $B$-independent in single-band Drude even though $\sigma_{xx}$ shrinks; invert the tensor.  
- **Assuming $R_{H}=-1/ne$ universally**: multiband compensation and warped Fermi surfaces can flip the sign or reduce magnitude.  
- **Overusing constant $\tau$**: energy- or angle-dependent scattering changes $L$, $S$, and MR; be cautious outside low-$T$ impurity-limited regimes.  
- **Mixing optical and transport masses**: cyclotron, thermodynamic, and band masses can differ in anisotropic or interacting systems.

---

**In summary:** Drude nails the operational picture—current is charge density times mobility, with simple AC and Hall responses. Sommerfeld injects quantum statistics, unlocking the correct low-$T$ thermodynamics and the Wiedemann–Franz law. Dress both with band structure and you have a workhorse framework for normal-state metals, from DC resistivity to infrared optics


## 10.4 Bloch Theorem & Band Structure

Periodic potentials take messy atomic chaos and compress it into clean momentum-space rules. The headline: **Bloch’s theorem** says electrons in a crystal move as plane waves modulated by a lattice-periodic envelope. From that, gaps pop open at Brillouin-zone boundaries, dispersions $E_{n}(\mathbf k)$ define velocities and effective masses, and both “nearly free” and “tight-binding” lenses become the same story, zoomed in from opposite sides.

---

### 10.4.1 Bloch states and the central equation

For a single electron in a periodic potential $V(\mathbf r+\mathbf R)=V(\mathbf r)$,

$$
\psi_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r) = e^{i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf r}\,u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r),\qquad u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r+\mathbf R)=u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r)
$$

Expand the lattice-periodic part in reciprocal vectors $\mathbf G$:

$$
u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r) = \sum_{\mathbf G} c_{n}(\mathbf k+\mathbf G)\,e^{i\mathbf G\cdot \mathbf r}
$$

and the potential as $V(\mathbf r)=\sum_{\mathbf G} U_{\mathbf G}\,e^{i\mathbf G\cdot \mathbf r}$. Insert into Schrödinger’s equation to get the **central equation**

$$
\left[\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\,|\mathbf k+\mathbf G|^{2} - E\right] c(\mathbf k+\mathbf G) + \sum_{\mathbf G'} U_{\mathbf G-\mathbf G'}\,c(\mathbf k+\mathbf G') = 0
$$

It’s an infinite linear system in the plane-wave coefficients $c$. Truncate sensibly and you get bands.

---

### 10.4.2 Zone folding and reduced vs extended zone

Free electrons have parabolas $E=\hbar^{2}|\mathbf k|^{2}/2m$ that repeat every reciprocal vector: $\mathbf k$ and $\mathbf k+\mathbf G$ are equivalent. You can:

- **Extended-zone**: keep $E(\mathbf k)$ as endlessly repeated parabolas in $k$-space  
- **Reduced-zone**: fold all momenta back into the first Brillouin zone; copies become separate **bands** indexed by $n$

When $V\neq 0$, states that were degenerate under folding **mix** and gaps open at the crossings.

---

### 10.4.3 Gaps from Bragg reflection: a 2×2 demo

At a boundary where $\mathbf k$ and $\mathbf k'=\mathbf k-\mathbf G$ are degenerate for the free electron, keep only those two plane waves in the central equation. The eigenproblem is

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_{\mathbf k} & U_{\mathbf G} \\
U_{\mathbf G}^{\ast} & \epsilon_{\mathbf k'}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
c_{\mathbf k} \\ c_{\mathbf k'}
\end{pmatrix}
= E
\begin{pmatrix}
c_{\mathbf k} \\ c_{\mathbf k'}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

with $\epsilon_{\mathbf q}=\hbar^{2}|\mathbf q|^{2}/2m$. At the exact zone boundary where $\epsilon_{\mathbf k}=\epsilon_{\mathbf k'}$, the two energies split as

$$
E_{\pm} = \epsilon_{0} \pm |U_{\mathbf G}|
$$

so the **band gap** is

$$
E_{g} = 2\,|U_{\mathbf G}|
$$

Moral: stronger Fourier components of the lattice potential at reciprocal vectors $\mathbf G$ carve bigger gaps at the corresponding Brillouin-zone planes.

---

### 10.4.4 Kronig–Penney in one line (1D intuition)

For a 1D periodic array of barriers (lattice constant $a$), the dispersion satisfies a transcendental relation

$$
\cos(ka) = \cos(\alpha a) + \frac{P}{\alpha a}\,\sin(\alpha a)
$$

where $\alpha=\sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$ in the wells and $P$ encodes barrier strength. Regions where the right-hand side has magnitude $\le 1$ are **allowed bands**; where it exceeds 1 are **forbidden gaps**. Tuning $P$ moves you smoothly from nearly free ($P\to 0$) to tight-binding ($P\gg 1$).

---

### 10.4.5 Group velocity, effective mass, and DOS

Band dispersion is not just eye candy; its derivatives are physics:

- **Group velocity**

$$
\mathbf v_{n}(\mathbf k) = \frac{1}{\hbar}\,\nabla_{\mathbf k} E_{n}(\mathbf k)
$$

- **Effective mass tensor** near an extremum

$$
\left(m_{n}^{\ast}\right)^{-1}_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{1}{\hbar^{2}}\,\left.\frac{\partial^{2}E_{n}}{\partial k_{\alpha}\,\partial k_{\beta}}\right|_{\mathbf k_{0}}
$$

Curvature $\uparrow$ ⇒ light mass; curvature $\downarrow$ ⇒ heavy mass. Negative curvature near a valence-band maximum means **holes** with positive charge and positive mass run the transport.

- **Density of states** for a single band in 3D

$$
g(E) = \frac{1}{4\pi^{3}} \int_{E_{n}(\mathbf k)=E} \frac{dS_{k}}{|\nabla_{\mathbf k} E_{n}|}
$$

The DOS diverges where the gradient vanishes along the constant-energy surface (van Hove singularities).

---

### 10.4.6 Nearly free vs tight-binding: two zoom levels, same film

- **Nearly free electron (NFE)**: start from parabolas and open gaps perturbatively where they cross. Good when $|U_{\mathbf G}| \ll \epsilon_{F}$.  
- **Tight-binding (TB)**: start from localized orbitals with hopping $t$ between sites; bands emerge from bonding/antibonding combinations. Best when orbitals are compact and $t$ is small compared to on-site energies.

Both are limits of the same Bloch machinery. NFE explains gap openings and light masses in simple metals; TB nails band shapes in covalent/ionic solids and will be our §10.5 focus (Wannier functions live here).

---

### 10.4.7 $k\cdot p$ method: local expansion near a band edge

Near a high-symmetry $\mathbf k_{0}$, expand the Hamiltonian as $H(\mathbf k)\approx H(\mathbf k_{0})+\frac{\hbar}{m}\,\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf p + \cdots$. Second-order perturbation yields

$$
\frac{1}{m^{\ast}_{\alpha\beta}} = \frac{1}{m}\delta_{\alpha\beta} + \frac{2}{m^{2}} \sum_{m\neq n} \frac{\langle n0|p_{\alpha}|m0\rangle \langle m0|p_{\beta}|n0\rangle}{E_{n0}-E_{m0}}
$$

where $\{|m0\rangle\}$ are Bloch states at $\mathbf k_{0}$. This connects effective mass to interband matrix elements and symmetry selection rules (e.g., heavy vs light holes in semiconductors).

---

### 10.4.8 Symmetry, degeneracies, and spin–orbit spice

- Crystal symmetry protects degeneracies at high-symmetry $k$ points and along lines. Breaking symmetry (strain, fields) splits them.  
- **Inversion** and **time reversal** together enforce Kramers doublets with spin.  
- **Spin–orbit coupling (SOC)** mixes spin and orbital character; with broken inversion you can get **Rashba**-like splittings. We stay light here and return to topology in §10.11.

---

### 10.4.9 Fermi surfaces and transport pointers

The **Fermi surface** is the constant-energy surface $E_{n}(\mathbf k)=\epsilon_{F}$. Its curvature and connectivity control:

- Cyclotron masses and quantum oscillations (de Haas–van Alphen, Shubnikov–de Haas)  
- Anisotropic conductivity and Hall effect (via velocities and lifetimes on the FS)  
- Nesting vectors that can amplify density-wave instabilities

Bloch dispersion + scattering time is the whole transport game in §10.7.

---

### 10.4.10 Wannier functions: real-space avatars of bands

A unitary transform of Bloch states over the BZ gives **Wannier functions** $|n,\mathbf R\rangle$ localized near cell $\mathbf R$. Smooth gauge choices yield maximally localized Wanniers that act like tight-binding orbitals and are perfect for model building, interpolation, and computing real-space responses. We build on this in §10.5.

---

### 10.4.11 ARPES and band mapping (how we see $E(\mathbf k)$)

**Angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES)** measures the occupied part of $E(\mathbf k)$ directly. In 2D materials it’s almost literal; in 3D there’s a $k_{z}$ wrinkle. Combine with quantum oscillations and optical conductivity to reconstruct the low-energy band structure that transport actually feels.

---

### 10.4.12 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Gap size from a single Fourier component**  
Take a 1D cosine potential $V(x)=2U_{G}\cos(Gx)$ with $G=2\pi/a$. Do the 2×2 central-equation truncation at $k=G/2$ and show $E_{g}=2|U_{G}|$.

**(b) Effective mass near a band minimum**  
For $E(k)\approx E_{0}+\alpha k^{2}+\beta k^{4}$ in 1D, extract $m^{\ast}=\hbar^{2}/(2\alpha)$ and discuss how the $k^{4}$ term skews DOS but not $m^{\ast}$ at the minimum.

**(c) DOS singularity in 2D**  
On a square lattice TB band $E(\mathbf k)=-2t(\cos k_{x}a+\cos k_{y}a)$, locate the saddle points and show the logarithmic van Hove singularity in $g(E)$.

**(d) Zone-folding check**  
Start from a free-electron parabola and fold by $\pm G$ into the first BZ. Draw where degeneracies occur and mark which get lifted when $U_{G}\neq 0$.

**(e) $k\cdot p$ for a direct-gap semiconductor**  
At $\Gamma$, use symmetry to argue that conduction and valence states have opposite parity so the linear-in-$k$ coupling vanishes; show why the conduction-band mass is then dominated by second-order coupling to remote bands.

---

### 10.4.13 Common pitfalls

- **Mixing reduced and extended zones**: keep track of whether a “crossing” is real or just a folded copy.  
- **Equating curvature with speed**: velocity is first derivative, not curvature; flat band $\Rightarrow$ heavy mass and slow carriers.  
- **Forgetting the basis**: selection rules and gap sizes depend on the **Fourier components** $U_{\mathbf G}$, which encode the atomic basis and bonding.  
- **Assuming parabolic everywhere**: effective-mass fits work only near extrema; far away, nonparabolicity and anisotropy matter.  
- **Ignoring SOC where it’s large**: in heavy elements or broken-inversion crystals, SOC reshapes band order and splitting—critical for topology.

---

### 10.4.14 Minimal problem kit

- Derive the central equation from the Bloch expansion and write it as a matrix eigenproblem for a finite set of $\mathbf G$  
- Perform the 2×2 gap-opening calculation at a generic zone plane with normal $\mathbf G$; obtain $E_{g}=2|U_{\mathbf G}|$  
- Compute $m^{\ast}$ tensor for an ellipsoidal constant-energy surface and relate it to cyclotron mass in a field along an arbitrary axis  
- For a 1D Kronig–Penney with delta barriers, plot allowed bands for several $P$ and identify the NFE and TB limits  
- Using a simple TB model on honeycomb, show how Dirac cones arise and how a staggered sublattice potential opens a mass gap

---

**In summary:** Bloch’s theorem turns periodicity into quantum order: plane waves modulated by a lattice envelope, dispersions defined on the Brillouin zone, and band gaps at Bragg planes set by the potential’s Fourier weight. Velocities come from slopes, masses from curvature, and the same framework houses both nearly free electrons and tight-binding Wanniers. Master $E_{n}(\mathbf k)$ and you’ve basically unlocked the rest of condensed matter

## 10.5 Tight-Binding & Wannier: From Local Orbitals to Bands

When electrons are more “homebody” than “frequent flyer,” **tight-binding (TB)** is the lens. Start with localized atomiclike orbitals, let them hop between sites, and you get bands with shapes and symmetries carved by real-space chemistry. **Wannier functions** are the clean, orthonormal real-space avatars of Bloch bands, perfect for building models, computing responses, and adding fields or disorder. This section builds TB from scratch, adds multi-orbital and Slater–Koster rules, handles magnetic fields via Peierls phases, and shows how Wanniers tie to polarization and edge physics (SSH preview).

---

### 10.5.1 From orbitals to Bloch sums

Pick orbitals $\{\phi_{\alpha}(\mathbf r-\mathbf R-\boldsymbol\tau_{\alpha})\}$ centered on basis sites $\boldsymbol\tau_{\alpha}$ in cell $\mathbf R$, with orbital label $\alpha$ (e.g., $s,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}$).

Form **Bloch sums**

$$
\varphi_{\alpha\mathbf k}(\mathbf r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\mathbf R} e^{i\mathbf k\cdot(\mathbf R+\boldsymbol\tau_{\alpha})}\,\phi_{\alpha}(\mathbf r-\mathbf R-\boldsymbol\tau_{\alpha})
$$

Expand eigenstates as $\psi_{n\mathbf k}=\sum_{\alpha} c_{n\alpha}(\mathbf k)\,\varphi_{\alpha\mathbf k}$. Matrix elements

$$
H_{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf k)=\sum_{\mathbf R} e^{i\mathbf k\cdot(\mathbf R+\boldsymbol\tau_{\beta}-\boldsymbol\tau_{\alpha})}\,t_{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf R),\qquad
S_{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf k)=\sum_{\mathbf R} e^{i\mathbf k\cdot(\mathbf R+\boldsymbol\tau_{\beta}-\boldsymbol\tau_{\alpha})}\,s_{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf R)
$$

with **hopping** $t_{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf R)\equiv\langle \phi_{\alpha 0}|H|\phi_{\beta\mathbf R}\rangle$, **overlap** $s_{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf R)\equiv\langle \phi_{\alpha 0}|\phi_{\beta\mathbf R}\rangle$. Solve the **generalized** eigenproblem

$$
H(\mathbf k)\,c_{n}(\mathbf k)=E_{n}(\mathbf k)\,S(\mathbf k)\,c_{n}(\mathbf k)
$$

In **orthogonal TB** we approximate $S=\mathbb I$.

---

### 10.5.2 1D monatomic chain (orthogonal TB)

One orbital per site, lattice constant $a$, on-site energy $\varepsilon_{0}$, nearest-neighbor hopping $-t$.

$$
E(k)=\varepsilon_{0}-2t\cos(ka)
$$

Bandwidth $W=4t$. Effective mass near an extremum at $k=0$ is

$$
\frac{1}{m^{\ast}}=\frac{1}{\hbar^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}E}{\partial k^{2}}=\frac{2ta^{2}}{\hbar^{2}}
$$

Sign of $t$ sets band **curvature** and which end is bonding vs antibonding.

---

### 10.5.3 Diatomic chain and the SSH teaser

Two sites per cell, $A$ at $0$, $B$ at $a/2$, hoppings $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ alternating. In the $(A,B)$ basis

$$
H(k)=
\begin{pmatrix}
\varepsilon_{A} & -t_{1}-t_{2}\,e^{-ika} \\
-t_{1}-t_{2}\,e^{ika} & \varepsilon_{B}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

For $\varepsilon_{A}=\varepsilon_{B}$ the dispersion is

$$
E_{\pm}(k)=\varepsilon_{0}\pm \sqrt{t_{1}^{2}+t_{2}^{2}+2t_{1}t_{2}\cos(ka)}
$$

Gap at the zone boundary $k=\pi/a$ is $2|t_{1}-t_{2}|$. The **SSH limit** ($\varepsilon_{A}=\varepsilon_{B}$) supports topological edge states when $|t_{2}|>|t_{1}|$ with open boundaries; we revisit the topology in §10.11.

---

### 10.5.4 Square and honeycomb lattices (classics)

**Square (1 orbital, nn)**

$$
E(\mathbf k)=\varepsilon_{0}-2t\big[\cos(k_{x}a)+\cos(k_{y}a)\big]
$$

**Honeycomb (graphene, 1 $p_{z}$ per site, nn)**. Two-site basis $A,B$ and three nn vectors $\{\boldsymbol\delta_{i}\}$:

$$
H(\mathbf k)=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -t\,\sum_{i=1}^{3}e^{i\mathbf k\cdot \boldsymbol\delta_{i}} \\
-t\,\sum_{i=1}^{3}e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot \boldsymbol\delta_{i}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Eigenvalues

$$
E_{\pm}(\mathbf k)=\pm t\,\Big|1+e^{i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf a_{1}}+e^{i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf a_{2}}\Big|
$$

Touch at **Dirac cones** $K,K'$ with linear dispersion and Fermi velocity $v_{F}=\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}at/\hbar$.

---

### 10.5.5 Multi-orbital TB and Slater–Koster rules

Hoppings depend on orbital orientation relative to the bond. **Slater–Koster** parameterizes two-center integrals using direction cosines $(l,m,n)$ between sites.

Examples:

- $s$–$s$: $t_{ss\sigma}$  
- $s$–$p$: $t_{sp\sigma}\,(l,m,n)$ projected on the $p$ axis  
- $p$–$p$: $\sigma$ and $\pi$ channels

For a bond along $\hat x$:

$$
\langle p_{x}|H|p_{x}\rangle = t_{pp\sigma},\qquad
\langle p_{y}|H|p_{y}\rangle = \langle p_{z}|H|p_{z}\rangle = t_{pp\pi}
$$

Cross-hoppings like $\langle s|H|p_{x}\rangle\propto t_{sp\sigma}$ times the appropriate direction cosine. This symmetry bookkeeping lets you write $H(\mathbf k)$ for real crystals quickly and keeps you from illegal hoppings.

---

### 10.5.6 Beyond nearest neighbors and van Hove moves

Adding next-nearest neighbors $t'$ etc. reshapes curvature and DOS singularities. On the square lattice

$$
E(\mathbf k)=\varepsilon_{0}-2t[\cos k_{x}a+\cos k_{y}a]-4t'\cos k_{x}a\cos k_{y}a
$$

Tuning $t'$ slides the **van Hove** saddle through $\epsilon_{F}$, a common route to instabilities (density waves, superconductivity) in layered materials.

---

### 10.5.7 Magnetic field: Peierls substitution

Minimal coupling in TB enters via **Peierls phases** on hoppings

$$
t_{ij}\ \longrightarrow\ t_{ij}\,\exp\!\left(\frac{ie}{\hbar}\int_{\mathbf r_{i}}^{\mathbf r_{j}} \mathbf A\cdot d\boldsymbol\ell\right)
$$

So the product of phases around a plaquette equals the magnetic flux $2\pi\Phi/\Phi_{0}$. On a square lattice with rational flux $\Phi/\Phi_{0}=p/q$, translation symmetry enlarges to a **magnetic unit cell** and the spectrum fractures into Hofstadter’s butterfly.

---

### 10.5.8 Disorder and real-space Green’s functions

Real materials have impurities. Add site randomness $\varepsilon_{i}$ or bond randomness $t_{ij}\to t_{ij}+\delta t_{ij}$. The TB Hamiltonian in real space is perfect for:

- **Anderson localization** studies (see §10.13)  
- **Surface/edge** spectra via finite ribbons and recursive Green’s functions  
- **Transport** with Landauer–Büttiker, where $G=(2e^{2}/h)\,T(E_{F})$ and $T$ comes from real-space TB + leads

---

### 10.5.9 Wannier functions: localized avatars of bands

Given Bloch states $\{|u_{n\mathbf k}\rangle\}$ in a band (or group) subspace, define **Wannier functions**

$$
|\,\mathbf R, n\,\rangle = \frac{V_{\text{BZ}}}{(2\pi)^{3}}\int_{\text{BZ}} d^{3}k\; e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf R}\, \sum_{m} U_{mn}(\mathbf k)\,|\,u_{m\mathbf k}\rangle
$$

where $U(\mathbf k)$ is a **gauge** unitary within the subspace. Properties:

- **Orthonormal** and **cell-localized**. The choice of $U(\mathbf k)$ controls spread  
- **Maximally localized Wanniers (MLWFs)** choose $U$ to minimize total spread $\Omega=\sum_{n}\big[\langle r^{2}\rangle_{n}-|\langle \mathbf r\rangle_{n}|^{2}\big]$  
- For isolated bands in trivial topology, exponentially localized Wanniers exist and reproduce the band exactly

**Tight-binding from Wannier.** Hoppings are matrix elements between Wanniers

$$
t_{nm}(\mathbf R)=\langle \mathbf 0,n|H|\mathbf R,m\rangle
$$

The **interpolation** $H(\mathbf k)=\sum_{\mathbf R} e^{i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf R}\,t(\mathbf R)$ gives bands indistinguishable from the ab initio subspace but at TB cost.

---

### 10.5.10 Polarization and Wannier centers (Berry twist)

Electronic polarization per cell of an insulator relates to Wannier **centers** $\mathbf r_{n}=\langle \mathbf 0,n|\hat{\mathbf r}| \mathbf 0,n\rangle$:

$$
\mathbf P = -\frac{e}{V_{\text{cell}}}\sum_{n}^{\text{occ}} \mathbf r_{n}\quad \text{modulo a quantum}
$$

Equivalent **Berry-phase formula** uses the Bloch gauge. Practically, track Wannier center flow under adiabatic changes to compute polarization differences and piezoelectric responses (topology returns in §10.11).

---

### 10.5.11 Edge physics with TB: the SSH demo in 15 seconds

Open a finite chain with alternating $t_{1},t_{2}$. In the **topological** phase $|t_{2}|>|t_{1}|$ you get midgap edge modes exponentially localized with decay $\sim (t_{1}/t_{2})^{x}$. Chiral symmetry pins them at $E=0$ until perturbations that break sublattice symmetry lift them.

---

### 10.5.12 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Wannier from a 1D cosine band**  
For $E(k)=\varepsilon_{0}-2t\cos ka$, show the Wannier $w_{0}(x)$ is proportional to a modified Bessel $K_{0}(|x|/\xi)$ asymptotically, with localization length $\xi\sim a\sqrt{t/\Delta}$ set by the nearest gap.

**(b) Graphene Fermi velocity**  
From the honeycomb nn Hamiltonian, linearize near $K$ to get $H_{\text{Dirac}}=\hbar v_{F}\,\boldsymbol\sigma\cdot \mathbf q$ and extract $v_{F}=\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}at/\hbar$.

**(c) Slater–Koster on a cubic bond**  
For a cubic crystal with one $s$ and three $p$ orbitals per site and nn bonds along axes, write $H(\mathbf k)$ using $t_{ss\sigma},t_{sp\sigma},t_{pp\sigma},t_{pp\pi}$.

**(d) Peierls phase check**  
On a square lattice in Landau gauge $\mathbf A=(0,Bx,0)$, show the hopping along $\hat y$ picks a phase $e^{i 2\pi \phi\, m}$ with $\phi\equiv \Phi/\Phi_{0}$ and $m$ the $x$-index, while $\hat x$ hoppings stay real.

**(e) Overlap matters**  
Include a nearest-neighbor overlap $s$ in the 1D chain and solve the generalized eigenproblem to show the dispersion becomes $E(k)=(\varepsilon_{0}-2t\cos ka)/(1+2s\cos ka)$.

**(f) SSH edge states**  
Diagonalize a 40-site open SSH chain numerically (TB) and plot the wavefunctions of the two midgap states; verify exponential localization and parity on opposite ends.

### 10.5.13 Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting overlap**: many intro TBs set $S=\mathbb I$; when orbitals are not orthogonal, use the generalized problem or orthogonalize first  
- **Illegal hoppings**: if symmetry forbids a matrix element, do not sneak it in. Use Slater–Koster or group theory to zero the right terms  
- **Gauge sloppiness in Wanniers**: random phases across $\mathbf k$ give delocalized Wanniers. MLWFs fix the gauge—do that before trusting real-space hoppings  
- **Peierls without flux accounting**: ensure the product of link phases equals $2\pi\Phi/\Phi_{0}$ per plaquette, independent of gauge  
- **Overfitting TB**: too many parameters hide physics and blow up outside the fit window. Start minimal; add neighbors only as data demand

---

### 10.5.14 Minimal problem kit

- Build the 1D and diatomic TB dispersions and extract effective masses around band edges  
- Write the honeycomb nn Hamiltonian, find $K,K'$, linearize to obtain the Dirac Hamiltonian and $v_{F}$  
- Use Slater–Koster to construct a $sp^{2}$ TB for graphene including $pp\pi$ and $pp\sigma$ sectors; discuss why $p_{z}$ decouples in the flat sheet  
- Implement Peierls phases for square-lattice TB at rational flux $p/q$ and plot the Hofstadter spectrum for $q\le 10$  
- Generate MLWFs for a two-band toy model, compute $t(\mathbf R)$, and show Wannier-interpolated $E(\mathbf k)$ matches the exact band to machine precision  
- Compute the polarization change from a sliding dimerization in the SSH model via Wannier center shift and compare with the Berry-phase result

---

**In summary:** Tight-binding turns chemistry into band shapes, with hoppings and on-site energies as the dials. Wannier functions are the tidy, localized basis that reproduces those bands and makes adding fields, disorder, and boundaries straightforward. Master TB matrices, Peierls phases, and Wannier gauges, and you’ll prototype real materials—and their edge or transport phenomena—at laptop speed

## 10.6 Semiconductors & Doping

Semiconductors are metals on “hard mode”: carriers are scarce until you tune the band gap, sprinkle dopants, or shine photons. This section builds the effective-mass picture, intrinsic vs doped statistics, drift–diffusion with the Einstein relation, recombination channels, optical fingerprints, and the minimalist pn-junction toolkit. We keep it band-structure real while staying device-friendly.

---

### 10.6.1 Band edges, effective masses, and densities of states

Near a conduction minimum and a valence maximum,

$$
E_{c}(\mathbf k) \approx E_{c0} + \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2}\,\mathbf k^{\mathsf T} m_{e}^{\ast -1}\,\mathbf k,\qquad
E_{v}(\mathbf k) \approx E_{v0} - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2}\,\mathbf k^{\mathsf T} m_{h}^{\ast -1}\,\mathbf k
$$

Define the band gap $E_{g}=E_{c0}-E_{v0}$. Effective-mass tensors $m_{e}^{\ast},m_{h}^{\ast}$ may be anisotropic; often one uses DOS masses $m_{e}^{\ast,\mathrm{DOS}}, m_{h}^{\ast,\mathrm{DOS}}$ to define 3D densities of states

$$
N_{c}(T) = 2\left(\frac{m_{e}^{\ast,\mathrm{DOS}} k_{B} T}{2\pi\hbar^{2}}\right)^{3/2},\qquad
N_{v}(T) = 2\left(\frac{m_{h}^{\ast,\mathrm{DOS}} k_{B} T}{2\pi\hbar^{2}}\right)^{3/2}
$$

These feed the carrier statistics.

---

### 10.6.2 Intrinsic carriers and the mass-action law

With Fermi level $E_{F}$, nondegenerate (Boltzmann) populations are

$$
n = N_{c}\,e^{-(E_{c0}-E_{F})/k_{B}T},\qquad
p = N_{v}\,e^{-(E_{F}-E_{v0})/k_{B}T}
$$

Multiply to get the **mass-action law**

$$
np = n_{i}^{2},\qquad
n_{i}(T) = \sqrt{N_{c}N_{v}}\;e^{-E_{g}/(2k_{B}T)} \propto T^{3/2}\,e^{-E_{g}/(2k_{B}T)}
$$

In an intrinsic crystal $n=p=n_{i}$ and $E_{F}$ sits near midgap skewed by DOS masses.

---

### 10.6.3 Doping: donors, acceptors, and charge neutrality

Substitutional dopants add shallow hydrogenic levels. Effective-mass theory gives

$$
E_{D} \approx \frac{m_{e}^{\ast}}{m_{e}} \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{r}^{2}}\,13.6\ \mathrm{eV},\qquad
a_{D}^{\ast} \approx \varepsilon_{r}\,\frac{m_{e}}{m_{e}^{\ast}}\,a_{0}
$$

Similarly for acceptors with $m_{h}^{\ast}$. At room $T$, shallow dopants are usually ionized.

For an n-type crystal with donor density $N_{D}$ and acceptors $N_{A}$,

$$
n - p + N_{A}^{-} - N_{D}^{+} = 0
$$

Assuming full ionization in the nondegenerate regime, $N_{D}^{+}\approx N_{D}$ and $N_{A}^{-}\approx N_{A}$. Then

$$
n \approx \frac{1}{2}\left[(N_{D}-N_{A}) + \sqrt{(N_{D}-N_{A})^{2} + 4 n_{i}^{2}}\right],\qquad
p = \frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n}
$$

In the **majority-carrier** limit $N_{D}\gg n_{i}$, $n\approx N_{D}-N_{A}$ and $p\approx n_{i}^{2}/n$.

At low $T$, partial ionization leads to a **freeze-out** region where $n<N_{D}$; use Fermi–Dirac occupancy of dopant levels.

---

### 10.6.4 Mobilities, scattering, and conductivity

Each carrier has mobility $\mu$ with drift velocity $\mathbf v_{d}=\pm \mu \mathbf E$. Conductivity is

$$
\sigma = q\,(n\mu_{n} + p\mu_{p}),\qquad \rho = \frac{1}{\sigma}
$$

Scattering sources:

- Lattice (phonons): typically $\mu \propto T^{-3/2}$ in 3D  
- Ionized impurities: $\mu \propto T^{+3/2}$ at low $T$  
- Matthiessen’s rule for rates: $\mu^{-1}\approx \mu_{\mathrm{ph}}^{-1}+\mu_{\mathrm{imp}}^{-1}+\cdots$

Two-carrier Hall coefficient (weak field) shows compensation:

$$
R_{H} = \frac{p\mu_{p}^{2} - n\mu_{n}^{2}}{q\,(n\mu_{n}+p\mu_{p})^{2}}
$$

Sign reveals the dominant carrier type.

---

### 10.6.5 Drift–diffusion and Einstein relation

Carrier continuity with drift and diffusion reads

$$
\mathbf J_{n} = q\,n\mu_{n}\mathbf E + q D_{n}\nabla n,\qquad
\mathbf J_{p} = q\,p\mu_{p}\mathbf E - q D_{p}\nabla p
$$

In nondegenerate statistics,

$$
D_{n} = \frac{k_{B}T}{q}\,\mu_{n},\qquad
D_{p} = \frac{k_{B}T}{q}\,\mu_{p}
$$

This **Einstein relation** is the semiconductor face of fluctuation–dissipation.

---

### 10.6.6 Recombination, lifetime, and quasi-Fermi levels

Out of equilibrium (illumination, injection), electrons and holes can be described by **quasi-Fermi levels** $E_{Fn},E_{Fp}$ with

$$
n = N_{c}\,e^{-(E_{c0}-E_{Fn})/k_{B}T},\qquad
p = N_{v}\,e^{-(E_{Fp}-E_{v0})/k_{B}T}
$$

Net recombination–generation channels:

- **Radiative (band-to-band)**: $R_{\mathrm{rad}} = B\,(np - n_{i}^{2})$  
- **Shockley–Read–Hall (trap-mediated)**: roughly $R_{\mathrm{SRH}} \approx \frac{np - n_{i}^{2}}{\tau_{p}(n+n_{1}) + \tau_{n}(p+p_{1})}$ with trap parameters $n_{1},p_{1}$  
- **Auger**: $R_{\mathrm{Auger}} = C_{n} n (np-n_{i}^{2}) + C_{p} p (np-n_{i}^{2})$

Define minority-carrier lifetime $\tau$ via small-signal $R\approx \delta n/\tau$. Lifetimes set diffusion lengths $L=\sqrt{D\tau}$ that control photodiode and solar-cell collection.

---

### 10.6.7 Direct vs indirect gaps, absorption, and excitons

Optical absorption coefficient near the band edge:

- **Direct gap**: $\alpha(\hbar\omega)\propto \sqrt{\hbar\omega - E_{g}}$  
- **Indirect gap**: phonon-assisted, $\alpha$ rises slowly and shows temperature dependence

Binding of electron–hole pairs gives **excitons** with hydrogenic series. Effective-mass theory estimates

$$
E_{X} \approx \frac{\mu^{\ast}}{m_{e}}\,\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{r}^{2}}\,13.6\ \mathrm{eV},\qquad
a_{X}^{\ast} \approx \varepsilon_{r}\,\frac{m_{e}}{\mu^{\ast}}\,a_{0}
$$

with reduced mass $\mu^{\ast}=(m_{e}^{\ast} m_{h}^{\ast})/(m_{e}^{\ast}+m_{h}^{\ast})$. Excitonic peaks decorate the absorption edge in clean crystals and 2D materials.

---

### 10.6.8 Minimal pn junction: built-in potential, depletion, and diode law

Bring p and n regions together; carriers diffuse, leaving behind ionized dopants and forming a **depletion region** with built-in field. At equilibrium,

$$
V_{\mathrm{bi}} = \frac{k_{B}T}{q}\,\ln\!\left(\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{n_{i}^{2}}\right)
$$

Ignoring free charge in depletion (abrupt junction), the total depletion width under applied bias $V$ is

$$
W = \sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_{s}}{q}\,\frac{N_{A}+N_{D}}{N_{A}N_{D}}\,(V_{\mathrm{bi}} - V)}
$$

Forward bias reduces the barrier; the ideal **Shockley diode equation**:

$$
I = I_{0}\left(e^{qV/(k_{B}T)} - 1\right)
$$

where $I_{0}\propto n_{i}^{2}$ scales inversely with diffusion lengths and doping. Reverse bias nearly clamps at $-I_{0}$ until breakdown mechanisms kick in (Zener/tunneling or avalanche).

---

### 10.6.9 Metal–semiconductor contacts: ohmic vs Schottky in one breath

A metal on a lightly doped semiconductor forms either:

- **Ohmic** contact if the barrier is thin/low enough for tunneling or if heavy doping bends bands into easy injection  
- **Schottky** barrier with rectification otherwise. Barrier height is set by metal work function, semiconductor electron affinity, and interface pinning

Transport across a Schottky contact at forward bias often follows thermionic emission with $I\propto T^{2} e^{-q\Phi_{B}/k_{B}T}\,(e^{qV/k_{B}T}-1)$.

---

### 10.6.10 Temperature regimes (the three-act play)

For a doped semiconductor as $T$ rises:

1) **Freeze-out**: dopants partially ionized, $n<predictably< N_{D}$  
2) **Extrinsic**: plateau where $n\approx N_{D}$ (or $p\approx N_{A}$) and $np\approx n_{i}^{2}$  
3) **Intrinsic**: $n\approx p\approx n_{i}$ once $n_{i}$ surpasses dopant densities exponentially

Resistivity and Hall data vs $T$ let you read off activation energies and dominant scattering.

---

### 10.6.11 Worked mini-examples

**(a) Intrinsic carrier density**  
Given $m_{e}^{\ast,\mathrm{DOS}}=0.26\,m_{e}$, $m_{h}^{\ast,\mathrm{DOS}}=0.39\,m_{e}$, $E_{g}=1.12\ \mathrm{eV}$ at $300\ \mathrm{K}$, estimate $n_{i}$ for Si using the $T^{3/2} e^{-E_{g}/2k_{B}T}$ form.

**(b) Fermi level in doped Si**  
For $N_{D}=10^{16}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $n_{i}=10^{10}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ at $300\ \mathrm{K}$, find $n,p$ and locate $E_{F}$ relative to $E_{c0}$ via $n=N_{c} e^{-(E_{c0}-E_{F})/k_{B}T}$.

**(c) Einstein relation check**  
With measured $\mu_{n}=1350\ \mathrm{cm^{2}/Vs}$ in Si at $300\ \mathrm{K}$, compute $D_{n}$ and a diffusion length for $\tau_{n}=1\ \mu\mathrm{s}$.

**(d) Depletion width**  
For a Si pn junction with $N_{A}=10^{17}$, $N_{D}=10^{16}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, $\varepsilon_{s}=11.7\,\varepsilon_{0}$, compute $W$ at $V=0$ and at $V=0.6\ \mathrm{V}$.

**(e) Radiative vs SRH**  
Given $B=10^{-10}\ \mathrm{cm^{3}/s}$, $n=p=10^{15}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, estimate $R_{\mathrm{rad}}$ and compare to an SRH rate with $\tau=1\ \mu\mathrm{s}$.

### 10.6.12 Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting mass-action**: in equilibrium $np=n_{i}^{2}$ even in doped material; violations signal injection or illumination  
- **Using Einstein beyond its lane**: standard $D=\mu k_{B}T/q$ needs nondegenerate statistics; degenerate semiconductors require Fermi–Dirac corrections  
- **Assuming full ionization**: at low $T$ or for deeper dopants, solve dopant occupancy self-consistently  
- **Mixing DOS and conductivity masses**: $N_{c,v}(T)$ want DOS masses; transport needs conductivity (tensor) masses and scattering  
- **Ideal diode dogma**: real diodes have series resistance, recombination in depletion (ideality factor $n_{\mathrm{id}}>1$), and interface states

---

**In summary:** Start with parabolic band edges and effective masses, sprinkle statistics to get $n,p$, then steer carriers with drift–diffusion and the Einstein relation. Doping sets the script (majority/minority), recombination edits the runtime (lifetimes, diffusion lengths), optics reveals the gap character, and the pn junction is the minimal playground where it all meets. Master these moves and you can read a semiconductor’s band diagram like a storyboard
