# Newtonian Mechanics

## 1. Foundations

Newtonian mechanics treats **space**, **time**, and **mass** as absolute concepts.  
It provides the classical framework of physics, built upon **Newton’s three laws of motion** and the **law of universal gravitation**.

### 1.1 Newton’s Three Laws of Motion
1. **Law of Inertia**  
   A body remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force:
   $$
   \frac{d\vec v}{dt} = 0 \quad (\vec F_\text{net} = 0).
   $$

2. **Law of Acceleration**  
   The net force on a body equals mass times acceleration:
   $$
   \vec F_\text{net} = m \vec a = m \frac{d^2 \vec r}{dt^2}.
   $$

3. **Law of Action–Reaction**  
   For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction:
   $$
   \vec F_{12} = - \vec F_{21}.
   $$

## 2. Elementary Motions

### 2.1 Constant Acceleration
For one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration $a$:
$$
x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \tfrac{1}{2} a t^2, \quad v(t) = v_0 + a t.
$$

### 2.2 Projectile Motion
Two-dimensional motion with vertical acceleration $g$:
$$
x(t) = v_0 \cos\theta \, t, \quad 
y(t) = v_0 \sin\theta \, t - \tfrac{1}{2} g t^2.
$$

## 3. Conservation Laws and Symmetries

### 3.1 Linear Momentum Conservation
If no external force acts on a system:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\sum_i m_i \vec v_i = 0.
$$

### 3.2 Angular Momentum Conservation
For central forces (forces parallel to $\vec r$):
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\vec L = \frac{d}{dt} (\vec r \times m\vec v) = \vec r \times \vec F = 0.
$$

### 3.3 Mechanical Energy Conservation
If the net force is conservative:
$$
E = T + V = \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 + V(\vec r) = \text{constant}.
$$

## 4. Work and Energy

### 4.1 Work–Energy Theorem
The work done by the net force equals the change in kinetic energy:
$$
W = \int \vec F \cdot d\vec r = \Delta T.
$$

### 4.2 Potential Energy
For conservative forces, there exists a potential function $V$:
$$
\vec F = - \nabla V(\vec r).
$$

## 5. Dynamics of Systems of Particles

### 5.1 Center of Mass
Definition of the center of mass position:
$$
\vec R = \frac{1}{M}\sum_i m_i \vec r_i, \quad M = \sum_i m_i.
$$

Equation of motion for the center of mass:
$$
M \frac{d^2 \vec R}{dt^2} = \vec F_\text{ext}.
$$

### 5.2 Two-Body Reduction
Relative coordinate $\vec r = \vec r_1 - \vec r_2$ reduces the problem to an effective one-body system with reduced mass:
$$
\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}.
$$

## 6. Central Forces and Orbital Motion

### 6.1 Kepler Problem
Under inverse-square law:
$$
\vec F = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat r.
$$

Leads to conic-section orbits:
$$
r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta}, \quad p = \frac{L^2}{\mu G m_1 m_2}.
$$

### 6.2 Kepler’s Laws
1. Orbits are ellipses with the sun at one focus.  
2. Equal areas are swept in equal times.  
3. Orbital period $T$ satisfies:
   $$
   T^2 \propto a^3,
   $$
   where $a$ is the semi-major axis.

## 7. Rigid Body Mechanics

### 7.1 Rotation About a Fixed Axis
Angular momentum:
$$
L = I \omega, \quad T = \tfrac{1}{2} I \omega^2,
$$
with moment of inertia $I = \sum_i m_i r_i^2$.

### 7.2 Euler’s Equations
For a rigid body rotating with angular velocity $\vec \omega$:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}(I \vec \omega) + \vec \omega \times (I \vec \omega) = \vec \tau.
$$

---

## 8. Non-Inertial Frames

### 8.1 Fictitious Forces
In a rotating frame with angular velocity $\vec \Omega$, acceleration is:
$$
\vec a' = \vec a - 2 \vec \Omega \times \vec v' - \vec \Omega \times (\vec \Omega \times \vec r),
$$
where the extra terms correspond to **Coriolis** and **centrifugal** forces.

## 9. Summary

Newtonian mechanics provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the motion of particles, systems, and rigid bodies under forces. Its conservation laws stem from underlying symmetries (time translation $\to$ energy, spatial translation $\to$ momentum, rotational invariance $\to$ angular momentum). While ultimately superseded by relativity and quantum mechanics, it remains indispensable for describing the macroscopic world.
