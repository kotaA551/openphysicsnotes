# Curiosities: Black Hole Information Paradox

---

## 1. Classical Black Holes

In General Relativity, a black hole is a spacetime region with an **event horizon**.  
The simplest solution is the Schwarzschild metric:

$$
ds^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right) dt^2 
+ \left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)^{-1} dr^2 
+ r^2 d\Omega^2.
$$

Classically, nothing (not even light) escapes once it crosses $r=2GM$.  
Thus, information about the matter that fell in seems lost.

## 2. Hawking Radiation

Hawking (1974) combined quantum field theory with curved spacetime.  
He found that black holes emit thermal radiation:

$$
\langle N_\omega \rangle = \frac{1}{e^{\hbar \omega / k_B T_H} - 1},
$$

with **Hawking temperature**:

$$
T_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi GM k_B}.
$$

And the **Bekenstein–Hawking entropy**:

$$
S_{\text{BH}} = \frac{k_B c^3}{4 G \hbar} A,
$$

where $A$ is the horizon area.

## 3. The Information Paradox

If Hawking radiation is **purely thermal**, then:

- Initial state: pure (quantum field + collapsing matter)  
- Final state: mixed thermal state  

This implies **non-unitary evolution**:

$$
\rho_{\text{pure}} \;\;\longrightarrow\;\; \rho_{\text{thermal}}.
$$

But quantum mechanics requires **unitarity**.  
Thus, either:

1. **Quantum mechanics fails**, or  
2. **General relativity’s description of black holes fails**.  

This conflict is the **Black Hole Information Paradox**.

## 4. The Page Curve

Page argued (1993) that if unitarity holds, the entanglement entropy of radiation $S_{\text{rad}}(t)$ must follow the **Page curve**:

- Increases initially (Hawking’s result)  
- Peaks at **Page time** $t_{\text{Page}} \sim (1/2)\, t_{\text{evap}}$  
- Then decreases to zero as radiation becomes pure  

Hawking’s calculation predicts a monotonically increasing entropy, in contradiction with unitarity.

## 5. Proposed Resolutions

### (a) Information loss (Hawking’s original view)
Quantum mechanics is modified; evolution not unitary.  
But this undermines the foundation of QM.

### (b) Remnants
Black holes leave Planck-mass remnants storing information.  
Criticism: requires infinite species, problematic thermodynamics.

### (c) Information escapes with radiation
Quantum gravity corrections allow subtle correlations in Hawking radiation.  
Supported by **AdS/CFT correspondence**, which is manifestly unitary.

### (d) Firewalls
At the horizon, effective field theory breaks down, creating high-energy “firewalls” that destroy infalling observers.  
Violates the equivalence principle.

### (e) Islands and Quantum Extremal Surfaces
Recent progress (2019–2020):  
Using the **replica trick** and quantum extremal surfaces, the **island formula** reproduces the Page curve:

$$
S(R) = \min_{\mathcal{I}} \; \text{ext} \left\{ \frac{\text{Area}(\partial \mathcal{I})}{4G\hbar} + S_{\text{bulk}}(R \cup \mathcal{I}) \right\}.
$$

This suggests unitarity is preserved.

## 6. Status

- **Consensus today**: information is not lost.  
- AdS/CFT and the island formula strongly indicate **unitary evaporation**.  
- The precise **microscopic mechanism** in real (non-AdS) black holes remains under investigation.  

The paradox continues to be a **window into quantum gravity**.
