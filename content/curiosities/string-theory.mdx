## 1. From Points to Strings

In the Standard Model, particles are treated as **point-like** objects.  
But attempts to merge **quantum mechanics** and **general relativity** run into infinities.  

**String theory** proposes that the fundamental entities are **one-dimensional strings** instead of points.  

- Worldline of a particle → **worldsheet** of a string  
- Interactions are described as **splitting and joining of strings**

## 2. Classical Action: Polyakov Formulation

The motion of a string can be described by the **Polyakov action**:

$$
S = -\frac{T}{2} \int d^2\sigma \, \sqrt{-h} \, h^{ab} \, 
\partial_a X^\mu \, \partial_b X_\mu
$$

- $X^\mu(\sigma^a)$: embedding coordinates of the string ($\mu = 0,\dots,D-1$)  
- $h_{ab}$: worldsheet metric  
- $T$: string tension, usually $T = 1/(2\pi \alpha')$  

This action is invariant under **2D conformal symmetry**.  
Quantization imposes the requirement that the spacetime dimension be  

- $D=26$ for the **bosonic string**  
- $D=10$ for the **superstring**

## 3. Quantization and Spectrum

Quantization of string vibrations gives rise to particle spectra.  

### Mode expansion (open string):
$$
X^\mu(\tau,\sigma) = x^\mu + 2\alpha' p^\mu \tau 
+ i\sqrt{2\alpha'} \sum_{n\neq 0} \frac{1}{n} \alpha_n^\mu e^{-in\tau}\cos(n\sigma)
$$

- $\alpha_n^\mu$: oscillation modes  
- $x^\mu, p^\mu$: center-of-mass position and momentum  

### Mass spectrum:
$$
M^2 = \frac{1}{\alpha'}\left(N - a\right)
$$

where $N$ is the oscillator number operator, and $a$ is the normal ordering constant.  

- **Open strings**: include gauge bosons (photon-like states)  
- **Closed strings**: necessarily contain a **massless spin-2 particle = graviton**  

Thus, string theory **automatically includes quantum gravity**.

## 4. Superstrings and Dualities

The bosonic string suffers from instabilities (tachyons).  
Introducing **supersymmetry** leads to **superstring theory**.  

There are 5 consistent superstring theories:

1. Type I  
2. Type IIA  
3. Type IIB  
4. Heterotic $SO(32)$  
5. Heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$  

In the 1990s, **M-theory** was proposed:  
all five are just different limits of a single **11-dimensional theory**.  

Dualities:

- **T-duality**: relates compactification radii $R \leftrightarrow \alpha'/R$  
- **S-duality**: relates strong coupling ↔ weak coupling

## 5. AdS/CFT Correspondence

Maldacena (1997) proposed the **AdS/CFT duality**:

$$
Z_{\text{string}}[\phi \to \phi_0] \;=\; Z_{\text{CFT}}[\phi_0]
$$

- String theory on **AdS space** $\leftrightarrow$ Conformal Field Theory (CFT) on the boundary  
- Gauge/gravity duality: spacetime geometry emerges from quantum field theory data  

Applications:  
- Black hole entropy  
- Thermalization in QFT  
- Quantum information and spacetime geometry

## 6. Challenges and Open Questions

- **Landscape problem**: $\sim 10^{500}$ possible vacua  
- **Experimental evidence**: none so far; string scale $\sim 10^{19}$ GeV  
- **Nature of spacetime**: at the deepest level, string theory questions "what is spacetime?"

## Status

String theory has generated deep mathematical insights (algebraic geometry, topology, number theory, quantum information).  

Yet as a **physical theory**, it remains incomplete.  
The biggest open problem: **how to test quantum gravity** in nature.
